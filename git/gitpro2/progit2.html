<h2 id="_preface_by_scott_chacon">Preface by Scott Chacon</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Welcome to the second edition of Pro Git.
The first edition was published over four years ago now.
Since then a lot has changed and yet many important things have not.
While most of the core commands and concepts are still valid today as the Git core team is pretty fantastic at keeping things backward compatible, there have been some significant additions and changes in the community surrounding Git.
The second edition of this book is meant to address those changes and update the book so it can be more helpful to the new user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When I wrote the first edition, Git was still a relatively difficult to use and barely adopted tool for the harder core hacker.
It was starting to gain steam in certain communities, but had not reached anywhere near the ubiquity it has today.
Since then, nearly every open source community has adopted it.
Git has made incredible progress on Windows, in the explosion of graphical user interfaces to it for all platforms, in IDE support and in business use.
The Pro Git of four years ago knows about none of that.
One of the main aims of this new edition is to touch on all of those new frontiers in the Git community.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Open Source community using Git has also exploded.
When I originally sat down to write the book nearly five years ago (it took me a while to get the first version out), I had just started working at a very little known company developing a Git hosting website called GitHub.
At the time of publishing there were maybe a few thousand people using the site and just four of us working on it.
As I write this introduction, GitHub is announcing our 10 millionth hosted project, with nearly 5 million registered developer accounts and over 230 employees.
Love it or hate it, GitHub has heavily changed large swaths of the Open Source community in a way that was barely conceivable when I sat down to write the first edition.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I wrote a small section in the original version of Pro Git about GitHub as an example of hosted Git which I was never very comfortable with.
I didn&#8217;t much like that I was writing what I felt was essentially a community resource and also talking about my company in it.
While I still don&#8217;t love that conflict of interests, the importance of GitHub in the Git community is unavoidable.
Instead of an example of Git hosting, I have decided to turn that part of the book into more deeply describing what GitHub is and how to effectively use it.
If you are going to learn how to use Git then knowing how to use GitHub will help you take part in a huge community, which is valuable no matter which Git host you decide to use for your own code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other large change in the time since the last publishing has been the development and rise of the HTTP protocol for Git network transactions. Most of the examples in the book have been changed to HTTP from SSH because it&#8217;s so much simpler.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s been amazing to watch Git grow over the past few years from a relatively obscure version control system to basically dominating commercial and open source version control. I&#8217;m happy that Pro Git has done so well and has also been able to be one of the few technical books on the market that is both quite successful and fully open source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>I hope you enjoy this updated edition of Pro Git.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first edition of this book is what got me hooked on Git. This was my introduction to a style of making software that felt more natural than anything I had seen before. I had been a developer for several years by then, but this was the right turn that sent me down a much more interesting path than the one I was on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, years later, I&#8217;m a contributor to a major Git implementation, I&#8217;ve worked for the largest Git hosting company, and I&#8217;ve traveled the world teaching people about Git. When Scott asked if I&#8217;d be interested in working on the second edition, I didn&#8217;t even have to think.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s been a great pleasure and privilege to work on this book. I hope it helps you as much as it did me.</p>

<p>This chapter will be about getting started with Git.
We will begin by explaining some background on version control tools, then move on to how to get Git running on your system and finally how to get it set up to start working with.
At the end of this chapter you should understand why Git is around, why you should use it and you should be all set up to do so.</p>

<h3 id="_about_version_control">About Version Control</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
What is "version control", and why should you care?
Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
For the examples in this book you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use.
It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more.
Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover.
In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_local_version_control_systems">Local Version Control Systems</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Many people&#8217;s version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they&#8217;re clever).
This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone.
It is easy to forget which directory you&#8217;re in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don&#8217;t mean to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To deal with this issue, programmers long ago developed local VCSs that had a simple database that kept all the changes to files under revision control.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/local.png" alt="Local version control diagram">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 1. Local version control.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the more popular VCS tools was a system called RCS, which is still distributed with many computers today.
Even the popular Mac OS X operating system includes the <code>rcs</code> command when you install the Developer Tools.
RCS works by keeping patch sets (that is, the differences between files) in a special format on disk; it can then re-create what any file looked like at any point in time by adding up all the patches.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_centralized_version_control_systems">Centralized Version Control Systems</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
The next major issue that people encounter is that they need to collaborate with developers on other systems.
To deal with this problem, Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs) were developed.
These systems, such as CVS, Subversion, and Perforce, have a single server that contains all the versioned files, and a number of clients that check out files from that central place. 
For many years, this has been the standard for version control.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/centralized.png" alt="Centralized version control diagram">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 2. Centralized version control.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This setup offers many advantages, especially over local VCSs.
For example, everyone knows to a certain degree what everyone else on the project is doing.
Administrators have fine-grained control over who can do what; and it&#8217;s far easier to administer a CVCS than it is to deal with local databases on every client.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, this setup also has some serious downsides.
The most obvious is the single point of failure that the centralized server represents.
If that server goes down for an hour, then during that hour nobody can collaborate at all or save versioned changes to anything they&#8217;re working on.
If the hard disk the central database is on becomes corrupted, and proper backups haven&#8217;t been kept, you lose absolutely everything – the entire history of the project except whatever single snapshots people happen to have on their local machines.
Local VCS systems suffer from this same problem – whenever you have the entire history of the project in a single place, you risk losing everything.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_distributed_version_control_systems">Distributed Version Control Systems</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
This is where Distributed Version Control Systems (DVCSs) step in.
In a DVCS (such as Git, Mercurial, Bazaar or Darcs), clients don&#8217;t just check out the latest snapshot of the files: they fully mirror the repository.
Thus if any server dies, and these systems were collaborating via it, any of the client repositories can be copied back up to the server to restore it.
Every clone is really a full backup of all the data.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/distributed.png" alt="Distributed version control diagram">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 3. Distributed version control.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Furthermore, many of these systems deal pretty well with having several remote repositories they can work with, so you can collaborate with different groups of people in different ways simultaneously within the same project.
This allows you to set up several types of workflows that aren&#8217;t possible in centralized systems, such as hierarchical models.</p>

<h3 id="_a_short_history_of_git">A Short History of Git</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As with many great things in life, Git began with a bit of creative destruction and fiery controversy.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Linux kernel is an open source software project of fairly large scope.
For most of the lifetime of the Linux kernel maintenance (1991–2002), changes to the software were passed around as patches and archived files.
In 2002, the Linux kernel project began using a proprietary DVCS called BitKeeper.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In 2005, the relationship between the community that developed the Linux kernel and the commercial company that developed BitKeeper broke down, and the tool&#8217;s free-of-charge status was revoked.
This prompted the Linux development community (and in particular Linus Torvalds, the creator of Linux) to develop their own tool based on some of the lessons they learned while using BitKeeper.
Some of the goals of the new system were as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Speed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Simple design</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Strong support for non-linear development (thousands of parallel branches)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Fully distributed</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Able to handle large projects like the Linux kernel efficiently (speed and data size)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since its birth in 2005, Git has evolved and matured to be easy to use and yet retain these initial qualities.
It&#8217;s incredibly fast, it&#8217;s very efficient with large projects, and it has an incredible branching system for non-linear development (See <a href="#_git_branching">Git Branching</a>).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_git_basics">Git Basics</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, what is Git in a nutshell?
This is an important section to absorb, because if you understand what Git is and the fundamentals of how it works, then using Git effectively will probably be much easier for you.
As you learn Git, try to clear your mind of the things you may know about other VCSs, such as Subversion and Perforce; doing so will help you avoid subtle confusion when using the tool.
Git stores and thinks about information much differently than these other systems, even though the user interface is fairly similar, and understanding those differences will help prevent you from becoming confused while using it.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_snapshots_not_differences">Snapshots, Not Differences</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The major difference between Git and any other VCS (Subversion and friends included) is the way Git thinks about its data.
Conceptually, most other systems store information as a list of file-based changes.
These systems (CVS, Subversion, Perforce, Bazaar, and so on) think of the information they keep as a set of files and the changes made to each file over time.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/deltas.png" alt="Storing data as changes to a base version of each file.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 4. Storing data as changes to a base version of each file.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git doesn&#8217;t think of or store its data this way.
Instead, Git thinks of its data more like a set of snapshots of a miniature filesystem.
Every time you commit, or save the state of your project in Git, it basically takes a picture of what all your files look like at that moment and stores a reference to that snapshot.
To be efficient, if files have not changed, Git doesn&#8217;t store the file again, just a link to the previous identical file it has already stored.
Git thinks about its data more like a <strong>stream of snapshots</strong>.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/snapshots.png" alt="Git stores data as snapshots of the project over time.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 5. Storing data as snapshots of the project over time.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an important distinction between Git and nearly all other VCSs.
It makes Git reconsider almost every aspect of version control that most other systems copied from the previous generation.
This makes Git more like a mini filesystem with some incredibly powerful tools built on top of it, rather than simply a VCS.
We&#8217;ll explore some of the benefits you gain by thinking of your data this way when we cover Git branching in <a href="#_git_branching">Git Branching</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_nearly_every_operation_is_local">Nearly Every Operation Is Local</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most operations in Git only need local files and resources to operate – generally no information is needed from another computer on your network.
If you&#8217;re used to a CVCS where most operations have that network latency overhead, this aspect of Git will make you think that the gods of speed have blessed Git with unworldly powers.
Because you have the entire history of the project right there on your local disk, most operations seem almost instantaneous.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, to browse the history of the project, Git doesn&#8217;t need to go out to the server to get the history and display it for you – it simply reads it directly from your local database.
This means you see the project history almost instantly.
If you want to see the changes introduced between the current version of a file and the file a month ago, Git can look up the file a month ago and do a local difference calculation, instead of having to either ask a remote server to do it or pull an older version of the file from the remote server to do it locally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This also means that there is very little you can&#8217;t do if you&#8217;re offline or off VPN.
If you get on an airplane or a train and want to do a little work, you can commit happily until you get to a network connection to upload.
If you go home and can&#8217;t get your VPN client working properly, you can still work.
In many other systems, doing so is either impossible or painful.
In Perforce, for example, you can&#8217;t do much when you aren&#8217;t connected to the server; and in Subversion and CVS, you can edit files, but you can&#8217;t commit changes to your database (because your database is offline).
This may not seem like a huge deal, but you may be surprised what a big difference it can make.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_has_integrity">Git Has Integrity</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Everything in Git is check-summed before it is stored and is then referred to by that checksum.
This means it&#8217;s impossible to change the contents of any file or directory without Git knowing about it.
This functionality is built into Git at the lowest levels and is integral to its philosophy.
You can&#8217;t lose information in transit or get file corruption without Git being able to detect it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The mechanism that Git uses for this checksumming is called a SHA-1 hash.
This is a 40-character string composed of hexadecimal characters (0–9 and a–f) and calculated based on the contents of a file or directory structure in Git.
A SHA-1 hash looks something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>24b9da6552252987aa493b52f8696cd6d3b00373</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You will see these hash values all over the place in Git because it uses them so much.
In fact, Git stores everything in its database not by file name but by the hash value of its contents.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_generally_only_adds_data">Git Generally Only Adds Data</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you do actions in Git, nearly all of them only add data to the Git database.
It is hard to get the system to do anything that is not undoable or to make it erase data in any way.
As in any VCS, you can lose or mess up changes you haven&#8217;t committed yet; but after you commit a snapshot into Git, it is very difficult to lose, especially if you regularly push your database to another repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This makes using Git a joy because we know we can experiment without the danger of severely screwing things up.
For a more in-depth look at how Git stores its data and how you can recover data that seems lost, see <a href="#_undoing">Undoing Things</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_three_states">The Three States</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, pay attention.
This is the main thing to remember about Git if you want the rest of your learning process to go smoothly.
Git has three main states that your files can reside in: committed, modified, and staged.
Committed means that the data is safely stored in your local database.
Modified means that you have changed the file but have not committed it to your database yet.
Staged means that you have marked a modified file in its current version to go into your next commit snapshot.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This leads us to the three main sections of a Git project: the Git directory, the working tree, and the staging area.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/areas.png" alt="Working tree, staging area, and Git directory.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 6. Working tree, staging area, and Git directory.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Git directory is where Git stores the metadata and object database for your project.
This is the most important part of Git, and it is what is copied when you clone a repository from another computer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The working tree is a single checkout of one version of the project.
These files are pulled out of the compressed database in the Git directory and placed on disk for you to use or modify.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The staging area is a file, generally contained in your Git directory, that stores information about what will go into your next commit.
It&#8217;s sometimes referred to as the &#8220;index&#8221;, but it&#8217;s also common to refer to it as the staging area.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The basic Git workflow goes something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>You modify files in your working tree.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You stage the files, adding snapshots of them to your staging area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You do a commit, which takes the files as they are in the staging area and stores that snapshot permanently to your Git directory.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a particular version of a file is in the Git directory, it&#8217;s considered committed.
If it has been modified and was added to the staging area, it is staged.
And if it was changed since it was checked out but has not been staged, it is modified.
In <a href="#_git_basics_chapter">Git Basics</a>, you&#8217;ll learn more about these states and how you can either take advantage of them or skip the staged part entirely.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_command_line">The Command Line</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a lot of different ways to use Git.
There are the original command line tools, and there are many graphical user interfaces of varying capabilities.
For this book, we will be using Git on the command line.
For one, the command line is the only place you can run <strong>all</strong> Git commands – most of the GUIs only implement some subset of Git functionality for simplicity.
If you know how to run the command line version, you can probably also figure out how to run the GUI version, while the opposite is not necessarily true.
Also, while your choice of graphical client is a matter of personal taste, <em>all</em> users will have the command-line tools installed and available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So we will expect you to know how to open Terminal in Mac or Command Prompt or Powershell in Windows.
If you don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re talking about here, you may need to stop and research that quickly so that you can follow the rest of the examples and descriptions in this book.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_installing_git">Installing Git</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before you start using Git, you have to make it available on your computer.
Even if it&#8217;s already installed, it&#8217;s probably a good idea to update to the latest version.
You can either install it as a package or via another installer, or download the source code and compile it yourself.</p>

If you want to install the basic Git tools on Linux via a binary installer, you can generally do so through the basic package-management tool that comes with your distribution.
If you&#8217;re on Fedora for example, you can use yum:</p>
</div>

<h4 id="_installing_on_mac">Installing on Mac</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
There are several ways to install Git on a Mac.
The easiest is probably to install the Xcode Command Line Tools.
On Mavericks (10.9) or above you can do this simply by trying to run <em>git</em> from the Terminal the very first time.
If you don&#8217;t have it installed already, it will prompt you to install it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want a more up to date version, you can also install it via a binary installer.
An OSX Git installer is maintained and available for download at the Git website, at <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/mac" class="bare">http://git-scm.com/download/mac</a>.</p>

<p>There are also a few ways to install Git on Windows.
The most official build is available for download on the Git website.
Just go to <a href="http://git-scm.com/download/win" class="bare">http://git-scm.com/download/win</a> and the download will start automatically.
Note that this is a project called Git for Windows, which is separate from Git itself; for more information on it, go to <a href="https://git-for-windows.github.io/" class="bare">https://git-for-windows.github.io/</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another easy way to get Git installed is by installing GitHub for Windows.
The installer includes a command line version of Git as well as the GUI.
It also works well with Powershell, and sets up solid credential caching and sane CRLF settings.
We&#8217;ll learn more about those things a little later, but suffice it to say they&#8217;re things you want.

<h4 id="_installing_from_source">Installing from Source</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some people may instead find it useful to install Git from source, because you&#8217;ll get the most recent version.
The binary installers tend to be a bit behind, though as Git has matured in recent years, this has made less of a difference.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you do want to install Git from source, you need to have the following libraries that Git depends on: autotools, curl, zlib, openssl, expat, and libiconv.
For example, if you&#8217;re on a system that has yum (such as Fedora) or apt-get (such as a Debian based system), you can use one of these commands to install the minimal dependencies for compiling and installing the Git binaries:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo yum install dh-autoreconf curl-devel expat-devel gettext-devel \
  openssl-devel perl-devel zlib-devel
$ sudo apt-get install dh-autoreconf libcurl4-gnutls-dev libexpat1-dev \
  gettext libz-dev libssl-dev</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to be able to add the documentation in various formats (doc, html, info), these additional dependencies are required (Note: users of RHEL and RHEL-derivatives like CentOS and Scientific Linux will have to <a href="https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/EPEL#How_can_I_use_these_extra_packages.3F">enable the EPEL repository</a> to download the <code>docbook2X</code> package):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo yum install asciidoc xmlto docbook2X getopt
$ sudo apt-get install asciidoc xmlto docbook2x getopt</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, if you&#8217;re using Fedora/RHEL/RHEL-derivatives, you need to do this</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo ln -s /usr/bin/db2x_docbook2texi /usr/bin/docbook2x-texi</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>due to binary name differences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you have all the necessary dependencies, you can go ahead and grab the latest tagged release tarball from several places.
You can get it via the Kernel.org site, at <a href="https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git" class="bare">https://www.kernel.org/pub/software/scm/git</a>, or the mirror on the GitHub website, at <a href="https://github.com/git/git/releases" class="bare">https://github.com/git/git/releases</a>.
It&#8217;s generally a little clearer what the latest version is on the GitHub page, but the kernel.org page also has release signatures if you want to verify your download.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, compile and install:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ tar -zxf git-2.0.0.tar.gz

$ make all doc info
$ sudo make install install-doc install-html install-info</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After this is done, you can also get Git via Git itself for updates:</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each level overrides values in the previous level, so values in <code>.git/config</code> trump those in <code>/etc/gitconfig</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Windows systems, Git looks for the <code>.gitconfig</code> file in the <code>$HOME</code> directory (<code>C:\Users\$USER</code> for most people).
It also still looks for <code>/etc/gitconfig</code>, although it&#8217;s relative to the MSys root, which is wherever you decide to install Git on your Windows system when you run the installer.
If you are using version 2.x or later of Git for Windows, there is also a system-level config file at
<code>C:\Documents and Settings\All Users\Application Data\Git\config</code> on Windows XP, and in <code>C:\ProgramData\Git\config</code> on Windows Vista and newer.
This config file can only be changed by <code>git config -f &lt;file&gt;</code> as an admin.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_your_identity">Your Identity</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing you should do when you install Git is to set your user name and email address.
This is important because every Git commit uses this information, and it&#8217;s immutably baked into the commits you start creating:</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, you need to do this only once if you pass the <code>--global</code> option, because then Git will always use that information for anything you do on that system.
If you want to override this with a different name or email address for specific projects, you can run the command without the <code>--global</code> option when you&#8217;re in that project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many of the GUI tools will help you do this when you first run them.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_your_editor">Your Editor</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that your identity is set up, you can configure the default text editor that will be used when Git needs you to type in a message.

<p>You should have a basic understanding of what Git is and how it&#8217;s different from the centralized version control system you may have previously been using.
You should also now have a working version of Git on your system that&#8217;s set up with your personal identity.
It&#8217;s now time to learn some Git basics.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_git_basics_chapter">Git Basics</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you can read only one chapter to get going with Git, this is it.
This chapter covers every basic command you need to do the vast majority of the things you&#8217;ll eventually spend your time doing with Git.
By the end of the chapter, you should be able to configure and initialize a repository, begin and stop tracking files, and stage and commit changes.
We&#8217;ll also show you how to set up Git to ignore certain files and file patterns, how to undo mistakes quickly and easily, how to browse the history of your project and view changes between commits, and how to push and pull from remote repositories.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_getting_a_repo">Getting a Git Repository</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can get a Git project using two main approaches.
The first takes an existing project or directory and imports it into Git.
The second clones an existing Git repository from another server.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_initializing_a_repository_in_an_existing_directory">Initializing a Repository in an Existing Directory</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re starting to track an existing project in Git, you need to go to the project&#8217;s directory. If you&#8217;ve never done this, it looks a little different depending on which system you&#8217;re running:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>for Linux:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd /home/user/your_repository</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>for Mac:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd /Users/user/your_repository</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>for Windows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd /c/user/your_repository</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and type:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git init</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This creates a new subdirectory named <code>.git</code> that contains all of your necessary repository files – a Git repository skeleton.
At this point, nothing in your project is tracked yet.
(See <a href="#_git_internals">Git Internals</a> for more information about exactly what files are contained in the <code>.git</code> directory you just created.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to start version-controlling existing files (as opposed to an empty directory), you should probably begin tracking those files and do an initial commit.
You can accomplish that with a few <code>git add</code> commands that specify the files you want to track, followed by a <code>git commit</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git add *.c
$ git add LICENSE
$ git commit -m 'initial project version'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll go over what these commands do in just a minute.
At this point, you have a Git repository with tracked files and an initial commit.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_cloning">Cloning an Existing Repository</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to get a copy of an existing Git repository – for example, a project you&#8217;d like to contribute to – the command you need is <code>git clone</code>.
If you&#8217;re familiar with other VCS systems such as Subversion, you&#8217;ll notice that the command is "clone" and not "checkout".
This is an important distinction – instead of getting just a working copy, Git receives a full copy of nearly all data that the server has.
Every version of every file for the history of the project is pulled down by default when you run <code>git clone</code>.
In fact, if your server disk gets corrupted, you can often use nearly any of the clones on any client to set the server back to the state it was in when it was cloned (you may lose some server-side hooks and such, but all the versioned data would be there – see <a href="#_git_on_the_server">Getting Git on a Server</a> for more details).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You clone a repository with <code>git clone [url]</code>.
For example, if you want to clone the Git linkable library called libgit2, you can do so like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That creates a directory named &#8220;libgit2&#8221;, initializes a <code>.git</code> directory inside it, pulls down all the data for that repository, and checks out a working copy of the latest version.
If you go into the new <code>libgit2</code> directory, you&#8217;ll see the project files in there, ready to be worked on or used.
If you want to clone the repository into a directory named something other than &#8220;libgit2&#8221;, you can specify that as the next command-line option:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2 mylibgit</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That command does the same thing as the previous one, but the target directory is called <code>mylibgit</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git has a number of different transfer protocols you can use.
The previous example uses the <code>https://</code> protocol, but you may also see <code>git://</code> or <code>user@server:path/to/repo.git</code>, which uses the SSH transfer protocol.
<a href="#_git_on_the_server">Getting Git on a Server</a> will introduce all of the available options the server can set up to access your Git repository and the pros and cons of each.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_recording_changes_to_the_repository">Recording Changes to the Repository</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have a bona fide Git repository and a checkout or working copy of the files for that project.
You need to make some changes and commit snapshots of those changes into your repository each time the project reaches a state you want to record.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that each file in your working directory can be in one of two states: tracked or untracked.
Tracked files are files that were in the last snapshot; they can be unmodified, modified, or staged.
Untracked files are everything else – any files in your working directory that were not in your last snapshot and are not in your staging area.
When you first clone a repository, all of your files will be tracked and unmodified because Git just checked them out and you haven&#8217;t edited anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you edit files, Git sees them as modified, because you&#8217;ve changed them since your last commit.
You stage these modified files and then commit all your staged changes, and the cycle repeats.</p>

<div class="content">
<img src="images/lifecycle.png" alt="The lifecycle of the status of your files.">

</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_checking_status">Checking the Status of Your Files</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main tool you use to determine which files are in which state is the <code>git status</code> command.
If you run this command directly after a clone, you should see something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
nothing to commit, working directory clean</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means you have a clean working directory – in other words, none of your tracked files are modified.
Git also doesn&#8217;t see any untracked files, or they would be listed here.
Finally, the command tells you which branch you&#8217;re on and informs you that it has not diverged from the same branch on the server.
For now, that branch is always &#8220;master&#8221;, which is the default; you won&#8217;t worry about it here.
<a href="#_git_branching">Git Branching</a> will go over branches and references in detail.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s say you add a new file to your project, a simple README file.
If the file didn&#8217;t exist before, and you run <code>git status</code>, you see your untracked file like so:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ echo 'My Project' &gt; README
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Untracked files:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to include in what will be committed)

    README

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see that your new README file is untracked, because it&#8217;s under the &#8220;Untracked files&#8221; heading in your status output.
Untracked basically means that Git sees a file you didn&#8217;t have in the previous snapshot (commit); Git won&#8217;t start including it in your commit snapshots until you explicitly tell it to do so.
It does this so you don&#8217;t accidentally begin including generated binary files or other files that you did not mean to include.
You do want to start including README, so let&#8217;s start tracking the file.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_tracking_files">Tracking New Files</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to begin tracking a new file, you use the command <code>git add</code>.
To begin tracking the README file, you can run this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git add README</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you run your status command again, you can see that your README file is now tracked and staged to be committed:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can tell that it&#8217;s staged because it&#8217;s under the &#8220;Changes to be committed&#8221; heading.
If you commit at this point, the version of the file at the time you ran <code>git add</code> is what will be in the historical snapshot.
You may recall that when you ran <code>git init</code> earlier, you then ran <code>git add (files)</code> – that was to begin tracking files in your directory.
The <code>git add</code> command takes a path name for either a file or a directory; if it&#8217;s a directory, the command adds all the files in that directory recursively.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_staging_modified_files">Staging Modified Files</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s change a file that was already tracked.
If you change a previously tracked file called <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> and then run your <code>git status</code> command again, you get something that looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file appears under a section named &#8220;Changes not staged for commit&#8221; – which means that a file that is tracked has been modified in the working directory but not yet staged.
To stage it, you run the <code>git add</code> command.
<code>git add</code> is a multipurpose command – you use it to begin tracking new files, to stage files, and to do other things like marking merge-conflicted files as resolved.
It may be helpful to think of it more as &#8220;add this content to the next commit&#8221; rather than &#8220;add this file to the project&#8221;.
Let&#8217;s run <code>git add</code> now to stage the <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file, and then run <code>git status</code> again:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    new file:   README
    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both files are staged and will go into your next commit.
At this point, suppose you remember one little change that you want to make in <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> before you commit it.
You open it again and make that change, and you&#8217;re ready to commit.
However, let&#8217;s run <code>git status</code> one more time:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ vim CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status

    new file:   README

Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What the heck?
Now <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> is listed as both staged <em>and</em> unstaged.
How is that possible?
It turns out that Git stages a file exactly as it is when you run the <code>git add</code> command.
If you commit now, the version of <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> as it was when you last ran the <code>git add</code> command is how it will go into the commit, not the version of the file as it looks in your working directory when you run <code>git commit</code>.
If you modify a file after you run <code>git add</code>, you have to run <code>git add</code> again to stage the latest version of the file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git add CONTRIBUTING.md
$ git status

    new file:   README
    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_short_status">Short Status</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While the <code>git status</code> output is pretty comprehensive, it&#8217;s also quite wordy.
Git also has a short status flag so you can see your changes in a more compact way.
If you run <code>git status -s</code> or <code>git status --short</code> you get a far more simplified output from the command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git status -s
 M README
MM Rakefile
A  lib/git.rb
M  lib/simplegit.rb
?? LICENSE.txt</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>New files that aren&#8217;t tracked have a <code>??</code> next to them, new files that have been added to the staging area have an <code>A</code>, modified files have an <code>M</code> and so on.
There are two columns to the output - the left-hand column indicates the status of the staging area and the right-hand column indicates the status of the working tree.
So for example in that output, the <code>README</code> file is modified in the working directory but not yet staged, while the <code>lib/simplegit.rb</code> file is modified and staged.
The <code>Rakefile</code> was modified, staged and then modified again, so there are changes to it that are both staged and unstaged.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_ignoring">Ignoring Files</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often, you&#8217;ll have a class of files that you don&#8217;t want Git to automatically add or even show you as being untracked.
These are generally automatically generated files such as log files or files produced by your build system.
In such cases, you can create a file listing patterns to match them named <code>.gitignore</code>.
Here is an example <code>.gitignore</code> file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat .gitignore
*.[oa]
*~</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first line tells Git to ignore any files ending in &#8220;.o&#8221; or &#8220;.a&#8221; – object and archive files that may be the product of building your code.
The second line tells Git to ignore all files whose names end with a tilde (<code>~</code>), which is used by many text editors such as Emacs to mark temporary files.
You may also include a log, tmp, or pid directory; automatically generated documentation; and so on.
Setting up a <code>.gitignore</code> file before you get going is generally a good idea so you don&#8217;t accidentally commit files that you really don&#8217;t want in your Git repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The rules for the patterns you can put in the <code>.gitignore</code> file are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Blank lines or lines starting with <code>#</code> are ignored.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Standard glob patterns work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can start patterns with a forward slash (<code>/</code>) to avoid recursivity.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can end patterns with a forward slash (<code>/</code>) to specify a directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>You can negate a pattern by starting it with an exclamation point (<code>!</code>).</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Glob patterns are like simplified regular expressions that shells use.
An asterisk (<code>*</code>) matches zero or more characters; <code>[abc]</code> matches any character inside the brackets (in this case a, b, or c); a question mark (<code>?</code>) matches a single character; and brackets enclosing characters separated by a hyphen (<code>[0-9]</code>) matches any character between them (in this case 0 through 9).
You can also use two asterisks to match nested directories; <code>a/**/z</code> would match <code>a/z</code>, <code>a/b/z</code>, <code>a/b/c/z</code>, and so on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is another example .gitignore file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

<p>If the <code>git status</code> command is too vague for you – you want to know exactly what you changed, not just which files were changed – you can use the <code>git diff</code> command.
We&#8217;ll cover <code>git diff</code> in more detail later, but you&#8217;ll probably use it most often to answer these two questions: What have you changed but not yet staged?
And what have you staged that you are about to commit?
Although <code>git status</code> answers those questions very generally by listing the file names, <code>git diff</code> shows you the exact lines added and removed – the patch, as it were.</p>

<h4 id="_committing_changes">Committing Your Changes</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that your staging area is set up the way you want it, you can commit your changes.
Remember that anything that is still unstaged – any files you have created or modified that you haven&#8217;t run <code>git add</code> on since you edited them – won&#8217;t go into this commit.
They will stay as modified files on your disk.
In this case, let&#8217;s say that the last time you ran <code>git status</code>, you saw that everything was staged, so you&#8217;re ready to commit your changes.
The simplest way to commit is to type <code>git commit</code>:</p>
</div>

<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git commit</code></pre>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see that the default commit message contains the latest output of the <code>git status</code> command commented out and one empty line on top.
You can remove these comments and type your commit message, or you can leave them there to help you remember what you&#8217;re committing.
(For an even more explicit reminder of what you&#8217;ve modified, you can pass the <code>-v</code> option to <code>git commit</code>.
Doing so also puts the diff of your change in the editor so you can see exactly what changes you&#8217;re committing.)
When you exit the editor, Git creates your commit with that commit message (with the comments and diff stripped out).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Alternatively, you can type your commit message inline with the <code>commit</code> command by specifying it after a <code>-m</code> flag, like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you&#8217;ve created your first commit!
You can see that the commit has given you some output about itself: which branch you committed to (<code>master</code>), what SHA-1 checksum the commit has (<code>463dc4f</code>), how many files were changed, and statistics about lines added and removed in the commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that the commit records the snapshot you set up in your staging area.
Anything you didn&#8217;t stage is still sitting there modified; you can do another commit to add it to your history.
Every time you perform a commit, you&#8217;re recording a snapshot of your project that you can revert to or compare to later.</p>

<h4 id="_skipping_the_staging_area">Skipping the Staging Area</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Although it can be amazingly useful for crafting commits exactly how you want them, the staging area is sometimes a bit more complex than you need in your workflow.
If you want to skip the staging area, Git provides a simple shortcut.
Adding the <code>-a</code> option to the <code>git commit</code> command makes Git automatically stage every file that is already tracked before doing the commit, letting you skip the <code>git add</code> part:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git status

  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")
$ git commit -a -m 'added new benchmarks'

 1 file changed, 5 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice how you don&#8217;t have to run <code>git add</code> on the <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file in this case before you commit.
That&#8217;s because the <code>-a</code> flag includes all changed files.
This is convenient, but be careful; sometimes this flag will cause you to include unwanted changes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_removing_files">Removing Files</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
To remove a file from Git, you have to remove it from your tracked files (more accurately, remove it from your staging area) and then commit.
The <code>git rm</code> command does that, and also removes the file from your working directory so you don&#8217;t see it as an untracked file the next time around.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you simply remove the file from your working directory, it shows up under the &#8220;Changed but not updated&#8221; (that is, <em>unstaged</em>) area of your <code>git status</code> output:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ rm PROJECTS.md
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes not staged for commit:
  (use "git add/rm &lt;file&gt;..." to update what will be committed)
  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

        deleted:    PROJECTS.md

no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, if you run <code>git rm</code>, it stages the file&#8217;s removal:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git rm PROJECTS.md
rm 'PROJECTS.md'
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    deleted:    PROJECTS.md</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next time you commit, the file will be gone and no longer tracked.
If you modified the file and added it to the index already, you must force the removal with the <code>-f</code> option.
This is a safety feature to prevent accidental removal of data that hasn&#8217;t yet been recorded in a snapshot and that can&#8217;t be recovered from Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another useful thing you may want to do is to keep the file in your working tree but remove it from your staging area.
In other words, you may want to keep the file on your hard drive but not have Git track it anymore.
This is particularly useful if you forgot to add something to your <code>.gitignore</code> file and accidentally staged it, like a large log file or a bunch of <code>.a</code> compiled files.
To do this, use the <code>--cached</code> option:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git rm --cached README</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can pass files, directories, and file-glob patterns to the <code>git rm</code> command.
That means you can do things such as:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git rm log/\*.log</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the backslash (<code>\</code>) in front of the <code>*</code>.
This is necessary because Git does its own filename expansion in addition to your shell&#8217;s filename expansion.
This command removes all files that have the <code>.log</code> extension in the <code>log/</code> directory.
Or, you can do something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git rm \*~</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command removes all files whose names end with a <code>~</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_mv">Moving Files</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Unlike many other VCS systems, Git doesn&#8217;t explicitly track file movement.
If you rename a file in Git, no metadata is stored in Git that tells it you renamed the file.
However, Git is pretty smart about figuring that out after the fact – we&#8217;ll deal with detecting file movement a bit later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Thus it&#8217;s a bit confusing that Git has a <code>mv</code> command.
If you want to rename a file in Git, you can run something like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git mv file_from file_to</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>and it works fine.
In fact, if you run something like this and look at the status, you&#8217;ll see that Git considers it a renamed file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git mv README.md README
$ git status
On branch master
Your branch is up-to-date with 'origin/master'.
Changes to be committed:
  (use "git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;..." to unstage)

    renamed:    README.md -&gt; README</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, this is equivalent to running something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ mv README.md README
$ git rm README.md
$ git add README</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git figures out that it&#8217;s a rename implicitly, so it doesn&#8217;t matter if you rename a file that way or with the <code>mv</code> command.
The only real difference is that <code>git mv</code> is one command instead of three – it&#8217;s a convenience function.
More importantly, you can use any tool you like to rename a file, and address the add/rm later, before you commit.</p>

<p>You may be wondering what the difference is between <em>author</em> and <em>committer</em>.
The author is the person who originally wrote the work, whereas the committer is the person who last applied the work.
So, if you send in a patch to a project and one of the core members applies the patch, both of you get credit – you as the author, and the core member as the committer.

<h4 id="_limiting_log_output">Limiting Log Output</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to output-formatting options, <code>git log</code> takes a number of useful limiting options – that is, options that let you show only a subset of commits.
You&#8217;ve seen one such option already – the <code>-2</code> option, which show only the last two commits.
In fact, you can do <code>-&lt;n&gt;</code>, where <code>n</code> is any integer to show the last <code>n</code> commits.
In reality, you&#8217;re unlikely to use that often, because Git by default pipes all output through a pager so you see only one page of log output at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the time-limiting options such as <code>--since</code> and <code>--until</code> are very useful.
For example, this command gets the list of commits made in the last two weeks:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log --since=2.weeks</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command works with lots of formats – you can specify a specific date like <code>"2008-01-15"</code>, or a relative date such as <code>"2 years 1 day 3 minutes ago"</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also filter the list to commits that match some search criteria.
The <code>--author</code> option allows you to filter on a specific author, and the <code>--grep</code> option lets you search for keywords in the commit messages.
(Note that if you want to specify both author and grep options, you have to add <code>--all-match</code> or the command will match commits with either.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another really helpful filter is the <code>-S</code> option which takes a string and only shows the commits that introduced a change to the code that added or removed that string.
For instance, if you wanted to find the last commit that added or removed a reference to a specific function, you could call:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log -Sfunction_name</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last really useful option to pass to <code>git log</code> as a filter is a path.
If you specify a directory or file name, you can limit the log output to commits that introduced a change to those files.
This is always the last option and is generally preceded by double dashes (<code>--</code>) to separate the paths from the options.</p>

<h3 id="_undoing">Undoing Things</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At any stage, you may want to undo something.
Here, we&#8217;ll review a few basic tools for undoing changes that you&#8217;ve made.
Be careful, because you can&#8217;t always undo some of these undos.
This is one of the few areas in Git where you may lose some work if you do it wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the common undos takes place when you commit too early and possibly forget to add some files, or you mess up your commit message.
If you want to try that commit again, you can run commit with the <code>--amend</code> option:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git commit --amend</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command takes your staging area and uses it for the commit.
If you&#8217;ve made no changes since your last commit (for instance, you run this command immediately after your previous commit), then your snapshot will look exactly the same, and all you&#8217;ll change is your commit message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The same commit-message editor fires up, but it already contains the message of your previous commit.
You can edit the message the same as always, but it overwrites your previous commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example, if you commit and then realize you forgot to stage the changes in a file you wanted to add to this commit, you can do something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git commit -m 'initial commit'
$ git add forgotten_file

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_unstaging">Unstaging a Staged File</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next two sections demonstrate how to work with your staging area and working directory changes.
The nice part is that the command you use to determine the state of those two areas also reminds you how to undo changes to them.
For example, let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve changed two files and want to commit them as two separate changes, but you accidentally type <code>git add *</code> and stage them both.
How can you unstage one of the two?
The <code>git status</code> command reminds you:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git add *
$ git status

Changes to be committed:

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Right below the &#8220;Changes to be committed&#8221; text, it says use <code>git reset HEAD &lt;file&gt;...</code> to unstage.
So, let&#8217;s use that advice to unstage the <code>CONTRIBUTING.md</code> file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

  (use "git checkout -- &lt;file&gt;..." to discard changes in working directory)

    modified:   CONTRIBUTING.md</code></pre>
</div>
</div>

<h3 id="_remote_repos">Working with Remotes</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To be able to collaborate on any Git project, you need to know how to manage your remote repositories.
Remote repositories are versions of your project that are hosted on the Internet or network somewhere.
You can have several of them, each of which generally is either read-only or read/write for you.
Collaborating with others involves managing these remote repositories and pushing and pulling data to and from them when you need to share work.
Managing remote repositories includes knowing how to add remote repositories, remove remotes that are no longer valid, manage various remote branches and define them as being tracked or not, and more.
In this section, we&#8217;ll cover some of these remote-management skills.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_showing_your_remotes">Showing Your Remotes</h4>

<p>To see which remote servers you have configured, you can run the <code>git remote</code> command.
It lists the shortnames of each remote handle you&#8217;ve specified.

<h4 id="_adding_remote_repositories">Adding Remote Repositories</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve mentioned and given some demonstrations of how the <em>clone</em> command implicitly adds the <code>origin</code> remote for you.
Here&#8217;s how to add a new remote explicitly.
To add a new remote Git repository as a shortname you can reference easily, run <code>git remote add &lt;shortname&gt; &lt;url&gt;</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git remote
origin
$ git remote add pb https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
$ git remote -v
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (fetch)
origin	https://github.com/schacon/ticgit (push)
pb	https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (fetch)
pb	https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit (push)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you can use the string <code>pb</code> on the command line in lieu of the whole URL.
For example, if you want to fetch all the information that Paul has but that you don&#8217;t yet have in your repository, you can run <code>git fetch pb</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git fetch pb
remote: Counting objects: 43, done.

From https://github.com/paulboone/ticgit
 * [new branch]      master     -&gt; pb/master
 * [new branch]      ticgit     -&gt; pb/ticgit</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Paul&#8217;s master branch is now accessible locally as <code>pb/master</code> – you can merge it into one of your branches, or you can check out a local branch at that point if you want to inspect it.
(We&#8217;ll go over what branches are and how to use them in much more detail in <a href="#_git_branching">Git Branching</a>.)</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_fetching_and_pulling">Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you just saw, to get data from your remote projects, you can run:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git fetch [remote-name]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The command goes out to that remote project and pulls down all the data from that remote project that you don&#8217;t have yet.
After you do this, you should have references to all the branches from that remote, which you can merge in or inspect at any time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you clone a repository, the command automatically adds that remote repository under the name &#8220;origin&#8221;.
So, <code>git fetch origin</code> fetches any new work that has been pushed to that server since you cloned (or last fetched from) it.
It&#8217;s important to note that the <code>git fetch</code> command only downloads the data to your local repository – it doesn&#8217;t automatically merge it with any of your work or modify what you&#8217;re currently working on.
You have to merge it manually into your work when you&#8217;re ready.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your current branch is set up to track a remote branch (see the next section and <a href="#_git_branching">Git Branching</a> for more information), you can use the <code>git pull</code> command to automatically fetch and then merge that remote branch into your current branch.
This may be an easier or more comfortable workflow for you; and by default, the <code>git clone</code> command automatically sets up your local master branch to track the remote master branch (or whatever the default branch is called) on the server you cloned from.
Running <code>git pull</code> generally fetches data from the server you originally cloned from and automatically tries to merge it into the code you&#8217;re currently working on.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_pushing_remotes">Pushing to Your Remotes</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you have your project at a point that you want to share, you have to push it upstream.
The command for this is simple: <code>git push [remote-name] [branch-name]</code>.
If you want to push your master branch to your <code>origin</code> server (again, cloning generally sets up both of those names for you automatically), then you can run this to push any commits you&#8217;ve done back up to the server:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git push origin master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command works only if you cloned from a server to which you have write access and if nobody has pushed in the meantime.
If you and someone else clone at the same time and they push upstream and then you push upstream, your push will rightly be rejected.
You&#8217;ll have to fetch their work first and incorporate it into yours before you&#8217;ll be allowed to push.
See <a href="#_git_branching">Git Branching</a> for more detailed information on how to push to remote servers.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_inspecting_remote">Inspecting a Remote</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to see more information about a particular remote, you can use the <code>git remote show [remote-name]</code> command.
If you run this command with a particular shortname, such as <code>origin</code>, you get something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git remote show origin
* remote origin

  Remote branches:
    master                               tracked
    dev-branch                           tracked
  Local branch configured for 'git pull':
    master merges with remote master
  Local ref configured for 'git push':
    master pushes to master (up to date)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It lists the URL for the remote repository as well as the tracking branch information.
The command helpfully tells you that if you&#8217;re on the master branch and you run <code>git pull</code>, it will automatically merge in the master branch on the remote after it fetches all the remote references.
It also lists all the remote references it has pulled down.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is a simple example you&#8217;re likely to encounter.
When you&#8217;re using Git more heavily, however, you may see much more information from <code>git remote show</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command shows which branch is automatically pushed to when you run <code>git push</code> while on certain branches.
It also shows you which remote branches on the server you don&#8217;t yet have, which remote branches you have that have been removed from the server, and multiple local branches that are able to merge automatically with their remote-tracking branch when you run <code>git pull</code>.</p>

<h3 id="_git_tagging">Tagging</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Like most VCSs, Git has the ability to tag specific points in history as being important.
Typically people use this functionality to mark release points (v1.0, and so on).
In this section, you&#8217;ll learn how to list the available tags, how to create new tags, and what the different types of tags are.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_listing_your_tags">Listing Your Tags</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Listing the available tags in Git is straightforward.
Just type <code>git tag</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git tag

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_creating_tags">Creating Tags</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git uses two main types of tags: lightweight and annotated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lightweight tag is very much like a branch that doesn&#8217;t change – it&#8217;s just a pointer to a specific commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Annotated tags, however, are stored as full objects in the Git database.
They&#8217;re checksummed; contain the tagger name, email, and date; have a tagging message; and can be signed and verified with GNU Privacy Guard (GPG).
It&#8217;s generally recommended that you create annotated tags so you can have all this information; but if you want a temporary tag or for some reason don&#8217;t want to keep the other information, lightweight tags are available too.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_annotated_tags">Annotated Tags</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Creating an annotated tag in Git is simple.
The easiest way is to specify <code>-a</code> when you run the <code>tag</code> command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git tag -a v1.4 -m "my version 1.4"
$ git tag
v0.1
v1.3
v1.4</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>-m</code> specifies a tagging message, which is stored with the tag.
If you don&#8217;t specify a message for an annotated tag, Git launches your editor so you can type it in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see the tag data along with the commit that was tagged by using the <code>git show</code> command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git show v1.4

<h4 id="_lightweight_tags">Lightweight Tags</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Another way to tag commits is with a lightweight tag.
This is basically the commit checksum stored in a file – no other information is kept.
To create a lightweight tag, don&#8217;t supply the <code>-a</code>, <code>-s</code>, or <code>-m</code> option:</p>

<h3 id="_git_aliases">Git Aliases</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Before we finish this chapter on basic Git, there&#8217;s just one little tip that can make your Git experience simpler, easier, and more familiar: aliases.
We won&#8217;t refer to them or assume you&#8217;ve used them later in the book, but you should probably know how to use them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git doesn&#8217;t automatically infer your command if you type it in partially.
If you don&#8217;t want to type the entire text of each of the Git commands, you can easily set up an alias for each command using <code>git config</code>.
Here are a couple of examples you may want to set up:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global alias.co checkout
$ git config --global alias.br branch
$ git config --global alias.ci commit
$ git config --global alias.st status</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means that, for example, instead of typing <code>git commit</code>, you just need to type <code>git ci</code>.
As you go on using Git, you&#8217;ll probably use other commands frequently as well; don&#8217;t hesitate to create new aliases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This technique can also be very useful in creating commands that you think should exist.
For example, to correct the usability problem you encountered with unstaging a file, you can add your own unstage alias to Git:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global alias.unstage 'reset HEAD --'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This makes the following two commands equivalent:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git unstage fileA
$ git reset HEAD -- fileA</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This seems a bit clearer.
It&#8217;s also common to add a <code>last</code> command, like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global alias.last 'log -1 HEAD'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This way, you can see the last commit easily:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git last
commit 66938dae3329c7aebe598c2246a8e6af90d04646

    test for current head

    Signed-off-by: Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@example.com&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can tell, Git simply replaces the new command with whatever you alias it for.
However, maybe you want to run an external command, rather than a Git subcommand.
In that case, you start the command with a <code>!</code> character.
This is useful if you write your own tools that work with a Git repository.
We can demonstrate by aliasing <code>git visual</code> to run <code>gitk</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global alias.visual '!gitk'</code></pre>

<h2 id="_git_branching">Git Branching</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Nearly every VCS has some form of branching support.
Branching means you diverge from the main line of development and continue to do work without messing with that main line.
In many VCS tools, this is a somewhat expensive process, often requiring you to create a new copy of your source code directory, which can take a long time for large projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some people refer to Git&#8217;s branching model as its &#8220;killer feature,&#8221; and it certainly sets Git apart in the VCS community.
Why is it so special?
The way Git branches is incredibly lightweight, making branching operations nearly instantaneous, and switching back and forth between branches generally just as fast.
Unlike many other VCSs, Git encourages workflows that branch and merge often, even multiple times in a day.
Understanding and mastering this feature gives you a powerful and unique tool and can entirely change the way that you develop.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_git_branches_overview">Branches in a Nutshell</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To really understand the way Git does branching, we need to take a step back and examine how Git stores its data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you may remember from <a href="#_getting_started">Getting Started</a>, Git doesn&#8217;t store data as a series of changesets or differences, but instead as a series of snapshots.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you make a commit, Git stores a commit object that contains a pointer to the snapshot of the content you staged.
This object also contains the author&#8217;s name and email, the message that you typed, and pointers to the commit or commits that directly came before this commit (its parent or parents): zero parents for the initial commit, one parent for a normal commit, and multiple parents for a commit that results from a merge of two or more branches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To visualize this, let&#8217;s assume that you have a directory containing three files, and you stage them all and commit.
Staging the files computes a checksum for each one (the SHA-1 hash we mentioned in <a href="#_getting_started">Getting Started</a>), stores that version of the file in the Git repository (Git refers to them as blobs), and adds that checksum to the staging area:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git add README test.rb LICENSE
$ git commit -m 'The initial commit of my project'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you create the commit by running <code>git commit</code>, Git checksums each subdirectory (in this case, just the root project directory) and stores those tree objects in the Git repository.
Git then creates a commit object that has the metadata and a pointer to the root project tree so it can re-create that snapshot when needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your Git repository now contains five objects: one blob for the contents of each of your three files, one tree that lists the contents of the directory and specifies which file names are stored as which blobs, and one commit with the pointer to that root tree and all the commit metadata.</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 9. A commit and its tree</div>
</div>

<p>If you make some changes and commit again, the next commit stores a pointer to the commit that came immediately before it.</p>

<p>A branch in Git is simply a lightweight movable pointer to one of these commits.
The default branch name in Git is <code>master</code>.
As you start making commits, you&#8217;re given a <code>master</code> branch that points to the last commit you made.
Every time you commit, it moves forward automatically.</p>

<p>
What happens if you create a new branch?
Well, doing so creates a new pointer for you to move around.
Let&#8217;s say you create a new branch called testing.
You do this with the <code>git branch</code> command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch testing</code></pre>

<div class="title">Figure 12. Two branches pointing into the same series of commits</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>How does Git know what branch you&#8217;re currently on?
It keeps a special pointer called <code>HEAD</code>.
Note that this is a lot different than the concept of <code>HEAD</code> in other VCSs you may be used to, such as Subversion or CVS.
In Git, this is a pointer to the local branch you&#8217;re currently on.
In this case, you&#8217;re still on <code>master</code>.
The <code>git branch</code> command only <em>created</em> a new branch – it didn&#8217;t switch to that branch.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 13. HEAD pointing to a branch</div>

<p>You can easily see this by running a simple <code>git log</code> command that shows you where the branch pointers are pointing.

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_switching_branches">Switching Branches</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
To switch to an existing branch, you run the <code>git checkout</code> command.
Let&#8217;s switch to the new <code>testing</code> branch:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout testing</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 14. HEAD points to the current branch</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is the significance of that?
Well, let&#8217;s do another commit:</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ vim test.rb

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 15. The HEAD branch moves forward when a commit is made</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is interesting, because now your <code>testing</code> branch has moved forward, but your <code>master</code> branch still points to the commit you were on when you ran <code>git checkout</code> to switch branches.
Let&#8217;s switch back to the <code>master</code> branch:</p>
</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>That command did two things.
It moved the HEAD pointer back to point to the <code>master</code> branch, and it reverted the files in your working directory back to the snapshot that <code>master</code> points to.
This also means the changes you make from this point forward will diverge from an older version of the project.
It essentially rewinds the work you&#8217;ve done in your <code>testing</code> branch so you can go in a different direction.</p>

Both of those changes are isolated in separate branches: you can switch back and forth between the branches and merge them together when you&#8217;re ready.

<p>Because a branch in Git is actually a simple file that contains the 40 character SHA-1 checksum of the commit it points to, branches are cheap to create and destroy.
Creating a new branch is as quick and simple as writing 41 bytes to a file (40 characters and a newline).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is in sharp contrast to the way most older VCS tools branch, which involves copying all of the project&#8217;s files into a second directory.
This can take several seconds or even minutes, depending on the size of the project, whereas in Git the process is always instantaneous.
Also, because we&#8217;re recording the parents when we commit, finding a proper merge base for merging is automatically done for us and is generally very easy to do.
These features help encourage developers to create and use branches often.</p>

<p>Now you get the call that there is an issue with the website, and you need to fix it immediately.
With Git, you don&#8217;t have to deploy your fix along with the <code>iss53</code> changes you&#8217;ve made, and you don&#8217;t have to put a lot of effort into reverting those changes before you can work on applying your fix to what is in production.
All you have to do is switch back to your <code>master</code> branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, before you do that, note that if your working directory or staging area has uncommitted changes that conflict with the branch you&#8217;re checking out, Git won&#8217;t let you switch branches.
It&#8217;s best to have a clean working state when you switch branches.
There are ways to get around this (namely, stashing and commit amending) that we&#8217;ll cover later on, in <a href="#_git_stashing">Stashing and Cleaning</a>.
For now, let&#8217;s assume you&#8217;ve committed all your changes, so you can switch back to your <code>master</code> branch:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout master

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, your project working directory is exactly the way it was before you started working on issue #53, and you can concentrate on your hotfix.
This is an important point to remember: when you switch branches, Git resets your working directory to look like it did the last time you committed on that branch.
It adds, removes, and modifies files automatically to make sure your working copy is what the branch looked like on your last commit to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, you have a hotfix to make.
Let&#8217;s create a hotfix branch on which to work until it&#8217;s completed:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout -b hotfix

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can run your tests, make sure the hotfix is what you want, and merge it back into your <code>master</code> branch to deploy to production.

<p>You&#8217;ll notice the phrase &#8220;fast-forward&#8221; in that merge.
Because the commit <code>C4</code> pointed to by the branch <code>hotfix</code> you merged in was directly ahead of the commit <code>C2</code> you&#8217;re on, Git simply moves the pointer forward.
To phrase that another way, when you try to merge one commit with a commit that can be reached by following the first commit&#8217;s history, Git simplifies things by moving the pointer forward because there is no divergent work to merge together – this is called a &#8220;fast-forward.&#8221;</p>

<p>This looks a bit different than the <code>hotfix</code> merge you did earlier.
In this case, your development history has diverged from some older point.
Because the commit on the branch you&#8217;re on isn&#8217;t a direct ancestor of the branch you&#8217;re merging in, Git has to do some work.
In this case, Git does a simple three-way merge, using the two snapshots pointed to by the branch tips and the common ancestor of the two.</p>

<p>Instead of just moving the branch pointer forward, Git creates a new snapshot that results from this three-way merge and automatically creates a new commit that points to it.

This makes merging a heck of a lot easier in Git than in these other systems.</p>

<p>Anything that has merge conflicts and hasn&#8217;t been resolved is listed as unmerged.
Git adds standard conflict-resolution markers to the files that have conflicts, so you can open them manually and resolve those conflicts.
Your file contains a section that looks something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; HEAD:index.html

&lt;/div&gt;
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; iss53:index.html</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means the version in <code>HEAD</code> (your <code>master</code> branch, because that was what you had checked out when you ran your merge command) is the top part of that block (everything above the <code>=======</code>), while the version in your <code>iss53</code> branch looks like everything in the bottom part.
In order to resolve the conflict, you have to either choose one side or the other or merge the contents yourself.
For instance, you might resolve this conflict by replacing the entire block with this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-html" data-lang="html">&lt;div id="footer"&gt;

<p>This resolution has a little of each section, and the <code>&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;</code>, <code>=======</code>, and <code>&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;</code> lines have been completely removed.
After you&#8217;ve resolved each of these sections in each conflicted file, run <code>git add</code> on each file to mark it as resolved.
Staging the file marks it as resolved in Git.</p>

<h3 id="_branch_management">Branch Management</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Now that you&#8217;ve created, merged, and deleted some branches, let&#8217;s look at some branch-management tools that will come in handy when you begin using branches all the time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git branch</code> command does more than just create and delete branches.
If you run it with no arguments, you get a simple listing of your current branches:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch
  iss53
* master
  testing</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice the <code>*</code> character that prefixes the <code>master</code> branch: it indicates the branch that you currently have checked out (i.e., the branch that <code>HEAD</code> points to).
This means that if you commit at this point, the <code>master</code> branch will be moved forward with your new work.
To see the last commit on each branch, you can run <code>git branch -v</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch -v

* master  7a98805 Merge branch 'iss53'
  testing 782fd34 add scott to the author list in the readmes</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The useful <code>--merged</code> and <code>--no-merged</code> options can filter this list to branches that you have or have not yet merged into the branch you&#8217;re currently on.
To see which branches are already merged into the branch you&#8217;re on, you can run <code>git branch --merged</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch --merged
  iss53

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because you already merged in <code>iss53</code> earlier, you see it in your list.
Branches on this list without the <code>*</code> in front of them are generally fine to delete with <code>git branch -d</code>; you&#8217;ve already incorporated their work into another branch, so you&#8217;re not going to lose anything.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To see all the branches that contain work you haven&#8217;t yet merged in, you can run <code>git branch --no-merged</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch --no-merged

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This shows your other branch.
Because it contains work that isn&#8217;t merged in yet, trying to delete it with <code>git branch -d</code> will fail:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch -d testing
error: The branch 'testing' is not fully merged.
If you are sure you want to delete it, run 'git branch -D testing'.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you really do want to delete the branch and lose that work, you can force it with <code>-D</code>, as the helpful message points out.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_branching_workflows">Branching Workflows</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you have the basics of branching and merging down, what can or should you do with them?
In this section, we&#8217;ll cover some common workflows that this lightweight branching makes possible, so you can decide if you would like to incorporate it into your own development cycle.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_long_running_branches">Long-Running Branches</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Because Git uses a simple three-way merge, merging from one branch into another multiple times over a long period is generally easy to do.
This means you can have several branches that are always open and that you use for different stages of your development cycle; you can merge regularly from some of them into others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many Git developers have a workflow that embraces this approach, such as having only code that is entirely stable in their <code>master</code> branch – possibly only code that has been or will be released.
They have another parallel branch named <code>develop</code> or <code>next</code> that they work from or use to test stability – it isn&#8217;t necessarily always stable, but whenever it gets to a stable state, it can be merged into <code>master</code>.
It&#8217;s used to pull in topic branches (short-lived branches, like your earlier <code>iss53</code> branch) when they&#8217;re ready, to make sure they pass all the tests and don&#8217;t introduce bugs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In reality, we&#8217;re talking about pointers moving up the line of commits you&#8217;re making.
The stable branches are farther down the line in your commit history, and the bleeding-edge branches are farther up the history.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/lr-branches-1.png" alt="A linear view of progressive-stability branching.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 26. A linear view of progressive-stability branching</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s generally easier to think about them as work silos, where sets of commits graduate to a more stable silo when they&#8217;re fully tested.</p>
</div>
<div id="lrbranch_b" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/lr-branches-2.png" alt="A ``silo'' view of progressive-stability branching.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 27. A &#8220;silo&#8221; view of progressive-stability branching</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can keep doing this for several levels of stability.
Some larger projects also have a <code>proposed</code> or <code>pu</code> (proposed updates) branch that has integrated branches that may not be ready to go into the <code>next</code> or <code>master</code> branch.
The idea is that your branches are at various levels of stability; when they reach a more stable level, they&#8217;re merged into the branch above them.
Again, having multiple long-running branches isn&#8217;t necessary, but it&#8217;s often helpful, especially when you&#8217;re dealing with very large or complex projects.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_topic_branch">Topic Branches</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Topic branches, however, are useful in projects of any size.
A topic branch is a short-lived branch that you create and use for a single particular feature or related work.
This is something you&#8217;ve likely never done with a VCS before because it&#8217;s generally too expensive to create and merge branches.
But in Git it&#8217;s common to create, work on, merge, and delete branches several times a day.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You saw this in the last section with the <code>iss53</code> and <code>hotfix</code> branches you created.
You did a few commits on them and deleted them directly after merging them into your main branch.
This technique allows you to context-switch quickly and completely – because your work is separated into silos where all the changes in that branch have to do with that topic, it&#8217;s easier to see what has happened during code review and such.
You can keep the changes there for minutes, days, or months, and merge them in when they&#8217;re ready, regardless of the order in which they were created or worked on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Consider an example of doing some work (on <code>master</code>), branching off for an issue (<code>iss91</code>), working on it for a bit, branching off the second branch to try another way of handling the same thing (<code>iss91v2</code>), going back to your <code>master</code> branch and working there for a while, and then branching off there to do some work that you&#8217;re not sure is a good idea (<code>dumbidea</code> branch).
Your commit history will look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<img src="images/topic-branches-1.png" alt="Multiple topic branches.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 28. Multiple topic branches</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, let&#8217;s say you decide you like the second solution to your issue best (<code>iss91v2</code>); and you showed the <code>dumbidea</code> branch to your coworkers, and it turns out to be genius.
You can throw away the original <code>iss91</code> branch (losing commits <code>C5</code> and <code>C6</code>) and merge in the other two.
Your history then looks like this:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We will go into more detail about the various possible workflows for your Git project in <a href="#_distributed_git">Distributed Git</a>, so before you decide which branching scheme your next project will use, be sure to read that chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important to remember when you&#8217;re doing all this that these branches are completely local.
When you&#8217;re branching and merging, everything is being done only in your Git repository – no server communication is happening.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_remote_branches">Remote Branches</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Remote references are references (pointers) in your remote repositories, including branches, tags, and so on.
You can get a full list of remote references explicitly with <code>git ls-remote [remote]</code>, or <code>git remote show [remote]</code> for remote branches as well as more information.
Nevertheless, a more common way is to take advantage of remote-tracking branches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remote-tracking branches are references to the state of remote branches.
They&#8217;re local references that you can&#8217;t move; they&#8217;re moved automatically for you whenever you do any network communication.
Remote-tracking branches act as bookmarks to remind you where the branches in your remote repositories were the last time you connected to them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They take the form <code>(remote)/(branch)</code>.
For instance, if you wanted to see what the <code>master</code> branch on your <code>origin</code> remote looked like as of the last time you communicated with it, you would check the <code>origin/master</code> branch.
If you were working on an issue with a partner and they pushed up an <code>iss53</code> branch, you might have your own local <code>iss53</code> branch; but the branch on the server would point to the commit at <code>origin/iss53</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This may be a bit confusing, so let&#8217;s look at an example.
Let&#8217;s say you have a Git server on your network at <code>git.ourcompany.com</code>.
If you clone from this, Git&#8217;s <code>clone</code> command automatically names it <code>origin</code> for you, pulls down all its data, creates a pointer to where its <code>master</code> branch is, and names it <code>origin/master</code> locally.
Git also gives you your own local <code>master</code> branch starting at the same place as origin&#8217;s <code>master</code> branch, so you have something to work from.</p>

While &#8220;master&#8221; is the default name for a starting branch when you run <code>git init</code> which is the only reason it&#8217;s widely used, &#8220;origin&#8221; is the default name for a remote when you run <code>git clone</code>.
If you run <code>git clone -o booyah</code> instead, then you will have <code>booyah/master</code> as your default remote branch.</p>

<p>If you do some work on your local <code>master</code> branch, and, in the meantime, someone else pushes to <code>git.ourcompany.com</code> and updates its <code>master</code> branch, then your histories move forward differently.

<p>To synchronize your work, you run a <code>git fetch origin</code> command.
This command looks up which server &#8220;origin&#8221; is (in this case, it&#8217;s <code>git.ourcompany.com</code>), fetches any data from it that you don&#8217;t yet have, and updates your local database, moving your <code>origin/master</code> pointer to its new, more up-to-date position.</p>

<p>To demonstrate having multiple remote servers and what remote branches for those remote projects look like, let&#8217;s assume you have another internal Git server that is used only for development by one of your sprint teams.
This server is at <code>git.team1.ourcompany.com</code>.
You can add it as a new remote reference to the project you&#8217;re currently working on by running the <code>git remote add</code> command as we covered in <a href="#_git_basics_chapter">Git Basics</a>.
Name this remote <code>teamone</code>, which will be your shortname for that whole URL.</p>

<p>Now, you can run <code>git fetch teamone</code> to fetch everything the remote <code>teamone</code> server has that you don&#8217;t have yet.
Because that server has a subset of the data your <code>origin</code> server has right now, Git fetches no data but sets a remote-tracking branch called <code>teamone/master</code> to point to the commit that <code>teamone</code> has as its <code>master</code> branch.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>
When you want to share a branch with the world, you need to push it up to a remote that you have write access to.
Your local branches aren&#8217;t automatically synchronized to the remotes you write to – you have to explicitly push the branches you want to share.
That way, you can use private branches for work you don&#8217;t want to share, and push up only the topic branches you want to collaborate on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have a branch named <code>serverfix</code> that you want to work on with others, you can push it up the same way you pushed your first branch.

<p>This is a bit of a shortcut.
Git automatically expands the <code>serverfix</code> branchname out to <code>refs/heads/serverfix:refs/heads/serverfix</code>, which means, &#8220;Take my serverfix local branch and push it to update the remote&#8217;s serverfix branch.&#8221;
We&#8217;ll go over the <code>refs/heads/</code> part in detail in <a href="#_git_internals">Git Internals</a>, but you can generally leave it off.
You can also do <code>git push origin serverfix:serverfix</code>, which does the same thing – it says, &#8220;Take my serverfix and make it the remote&#8217;s serverfix.&#8221;
You can use this format to push a local branch into a remote branch that is named differently.
If you didn&#8217;t want it to be called <code>serverfix</code> on the remote, you could instead run <code>git push origin serverfix:awesomebranch</code> to push your local <code>serverfix</code> branch to the <code>awesomebranch</code> branch on the remote project.</p>

<p>
Checking out a local branch from a remote-tracking branch automatically creates what is called a &#8220;tracking branch&#8221; (and the branch it tracks is called an &#8220;upstream branch&#8221;).
Tracking branches are local branches that have a direct relationship to a remote branch.
If you&#8217;re on a tracking branch and type <code>git pull</code>, Git automatically knows which server to fetch from and branch to merge into.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you clone a repository, it generally automatically creates a <code>master</code> branch that tracks <code>origin/master</code>.
However, you can set up other tracking branches if you wish – ones that track branches on other remotes, or don&#8217;t track the <code>master</code> branch.
The simple case is the example you just saw, running <code>git checkout -b [branch] [remotename]/[branch]</code>.
This is a common enough operation that Git provides the <code>--track</code> shorthand:</p>

<p>In fact, this is so common that there&#8217;s even a shortcut for that shortcut. If the branch name you&#8217;re trying to checkout (a) doesn&#8217;t exist and (b) exactly matches a name on only one remote, Git will create a tracking branch for you:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout serverfix
Branch serverfix set up to track remote branch serverfix from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'serverfix'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To set up a local branch with a different name than the remote branch, you can easily use the first version with a different local branch name:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout -b sf origin/serverfix
Branch sf set up to track remote branch serverfix from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'sf'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, your local branch <code>sf</code> will automatically pull from <code>origin/serverfix</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you already have a local branch and want to set it to a remote branch you just pulled down, or want to change the upstream branch you&#8217;re tracking, you can use the <code>-u</code> or <code>--set-upstream-to</code> option to <code>git branch</code> to explicitly set it at any time.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch -u origin/serverfix
Branch serverfix set up to track remote branch serverfix from origin.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>

<td class="content">
<div class="title">Upstream shorthand</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you have a tracking branch set up, you can reference its upstream branch with the <code>@{upstream}</code> or <code>@{u}</code> shorthand.
So if you&#8217;re on the <code>master</code> branch and it&#8217;s tracking <code>origin/master</code>, you can say something like <code>git merge @{u}</code> instead of <code>git merge origin/master</code> if you wish.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to see what tracking branches you have set up, you can use the <code>-vv</code> option to <code>git branch</code>.
This will list out your local branches with more information including what each branch is tracking and if your local branch is ahead, behind or both.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So here we can see that our <code>iss53</code> branch is tracking <code>origin/iss53</code> and is &#8220;ahead&#8221; by two, meaning that we have two commits locally that are not pushed to the server.
We can also see that our <code>master</code> branch is tracking <code>origin/master</code> and is up to date.
Next we can see that our <code>serverfix</code> branch is tracking the <code>server-fix-good</code> branch on our <code>teamone</code> server and is ahead by three and behind by one, meaning that there is one commit on the server we haven&#8217;t merged in yet and three commits locally that we haven&#8217;t pushed.
Finally we can see that our <code>testing</code> branch is not tracking any remote branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that these numbers are only since the last time you fetched from each server.
This command does not reach out to the servers, it&#8217;s telling you about what it has cached from these servers locally.
If you want totally up to date ahead and behind numbers, you&#8217;ll need to fetch from all your remotes right before running this.
You could do that like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

<h4 id="_pulling">Pulling</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
While the <code>git fetch</code> command will fetch down all the changes on the server that you don&#8217;t have yet, it will not modify your working directory at all.
It will simply get the data for you and let you merge it yourself.
However, there is a command called <code>git pull</code> which is essentially a <code>git fetch</code> immediately followed by a <code>git merge</code> in most cases.
If you have a tracking branch set up as demonstrated in the last section, either by explicitly setting it or by having it created for you by the <code>clone</code> or <code>checkout</code> commands, <code>git pull</code> will look up what server and branch your current branch is tracking, fetch from that server and then try to merge in that remote branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally it&#8217;s better to simply use the <code>fetch</code> and <code>merge</code> commands explicitly as the magic of <code>git pull</code> can often be confusing.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_delete_branches">Deleting Remote Branches</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Suppose you&#8217;re done with a remote branch – say you and your collaborators are finished with a feature and have merged it into your remote&#8217;s <code>master</code> branch (or whatever branch your stable codeline is in).
You can delete a remote branch using the <code>--delete</code> option to <code>git push</code>.
If you want to delete your <code>serverfix</code> branch from the server, you run the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git push origin --delete serverfix
To https://github.com/schacon/simplegit
 - [deleted]         serverfix</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Basically all this does is remove the pointer from the server.
The Git server will generally keep the data there for a while until a garbage collection runs, so if it was accidentally deleted, it&#8217;s often easy to recover.</p>

<h3 id="_rebasing">Rebasing</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
In Git, there are two main ways to integrate changes from one branch into another: the <code>merge</code> and the <code>rebase</code>.
In this section you&#8217;ll learn what rebasing is, how to do it, why it&#8217;s a pretty amazing tool, and in what cases you won&#8217;t want to use it.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_basic_rebase">The Basic Rebase</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you go back to an earlier example from <a href="#_basic_merging">Basic Merging</a>, you can see that you diverged your work and made commits on two different branches.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/basic-rebase-1.png" alt="Simple divergent history.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 35. Simple divergent history</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The easiest way to integrate the branches, as we&#8217;ve already covered, is the <code>merge</code> command.
It performs a three-way merge between the two latest branch snapshots (<code>C3</code> and <code>C4</code>) and the most recent common ancestor of the two (<code>C2</code>), creating a new snapshot (and commit).</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/basic-rebase-2.png" alt="Merging to integrate diverged work history.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 36. Merging to integrate diverged work history</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, there is another way: you can take the patch of the change that was introduced in <code>C4</code> and reapply it on top of <code>C3</code>.
In Git, this is called <em>rebasing</em>.
With the <code>rebase</code> command, you can take all the changes that were committed on one branch and replay them on another one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, you&#8217;d run the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout experiment
$ git rebase master
First, rewinding head to replay your work on top of it...
Applying: added staged command</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It works by going to the common ancestor of the two branches (the one you&#8217;re on and the one you&#8217;re rebasing onto), getting the diff introduced by each commit of the branch you&#8217;re on, saving those diffs to temporary files, resetting the current branch to the same commit as the branch you are rebasing onto, and finally applying each change in turn.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/basic-rebase-3.png" alt="Rebasing the change introduced in `C4` onto `C3`.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 37. Rebasing the change introduced in <code>C4</code> onto <code>C3</code></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, you can go back to the <code>master</code> branch and do a fast-forward merge.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout master
$ git merge experiment</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 38. Fast-forwarding the master branch</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, the snapshot pointed to by <code>C4'</code> is exactly the same as the one that was pointed to by <code>C5</code> in the merge example.
There is no difference in the end product of the integration, but rebasing makes for a cleaner history.
If you examine the log of a rebased branch, it looks like a linear history: it appears that all the work happened in series, even when it originally happened in parallel.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often, you&#8217;ll do this to make sure your commits apply cleanly on a remote branch – perhaps in a project to which you&#8217;re trying to contribute but that you don&#8217;t maintain.
In this case, you&#8217;d do your work in a branch and then rebase your work onto <code>origin/master</code> when you were ready to submit your patches to the main project.
That way, the maintainer doesn&#8217;t have to do any integration work – just a fast-forward or a clean apply.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that the snapshot pointed to by the final commit you end up with, whether it&#8217;s the last of the rebased commits for a rebase or the final merge commit after a merge, is the same snapshot – it&#8217;s only the history that is different.
Rebasing replays changes from one line of work onto another in the order they were introduced, whereas merging takes the endpoints and merges them together.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_more_interesting_rebases">More Interesting Rebases</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also have your rebase replay on something other than the rebase target branch.
Take a history like <a href="#rbdiag_e">A history with a topic branch off another topic branch</a>, for example.
You branched a topic branch (<code>server</code>) to add some server-side functionality to your project, and made a commit.
Then, you branched off that to make the client-side changes (<code>client</code>) and committed a few times.
Finally, you went back to your server branch and did a few more commits.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 39. A history with a topic branch off another topic branch</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose you decide that you want to merge your client-side changes into your mainline for a release, but you want to hold off on the server-side changes until it&#8217;s tested further.
You can take the changes on client that aren&#8217;t on server (<code>C8</code> and <code>C9</code>) and replay them on your <code>master</code> branch by using the <code>--onto</code> option of <code>git rebase</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git rebase --onto master server client</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This basically says, &#8220;Take the <code>client</code> branch, figure out the patches since it diverged from the <code>server</code> branch, and replay these patches in the <code>client</code> branch as if it was based directly off the <code>master</code> branch instead.&#8221;
It&#8217;s a bit complex, but the result is pretty cool.</p>

<p>Now you can fast-forward your <code>master</code> branch (see <a href="#rbdiag_g">Fast-forwarding your master branch to include the client branch changes</a>):</p>

<h4 id="_rebase_peril">The Perils of Rebasing</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Ahh, but the bliss of rebasing isn&#8217;t without its drawbacks, which can be summed up in a single line:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Do not rebase commits that exist outside your repository.</strong></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you follow that guideline, you&#8217;ll be fine.
If you don&#8217;t, people will hate you, and you&#8217;ll be scorned by friends and family.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you rebase stuff, you&#8217;re abandoning existing commits and creating new ones that are similar but different.
If you push commits somewhere and others pull them down and base work on them, and then you rewrite those commits with <code>git rebase</code> and push them up again, your collaborators will have to re-merge their work and things will get messy when you try to pull their work back into yours.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example of how rebasing work that you&#8217;ve made public can cause problems.
Suppose you clone from a central server and then do some work off that.
Your commit history looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/perils-of-rebasing-1.png" alt="Clone a repository, and base some work on it.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 44. Clone a repository, and base some work on it</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, someone else does more work that includes a merge, and pushes that work to the central server.
You fetch it and merge the new remote branch into your work, making your history look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/perils-of-rebasing-2.png" alt="Fetch more commits, and merge them into your work.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 45. Fetch more commits, and merge them into your work</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, the person who pushed the merged work decides to go back and rebase their work instead; they do a <code>git push --force</code> to overwrite the history on the server.
You then fetch from that server, bringing down the new commits.</p>
</div>
<div id="_pre_merge_rebase_work" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/perils-of-rebasing-3.png" alt="Someone pushes rebased commits, abandoning commits you've based your work on.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 46. Someone pushes rebased commits, abandoning commits you&#8217;ve based your work on</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you&#8217;re both in a pickle.
If you do a <code>git pull</code>, you&#8217;ll create a merge commit which includes both lines of history, and your repository will look like this:</p>
</div>
<div id="_merge_rebase_work" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/perils-of-rebasing-4.png" alt="You merge in the same work again into a new merge commit.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 47. You merge in the same work again into a new merge commit</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you run a <code>git log</code> when your history looks like this, you&#8217;ll see two commits that have the same author, date, and message, which will be confusing.
Furthermore, if you push this history back up to the server, you&#8217;ll reintroduce all those rebased commits to the central server, which can further confuse people.
It&#8217;s pretty safe to assume that the other developer doesn&#8217;t want <code>C4</code> and <code>C6</code> to be in the history; that&#8217;s why they rebased in the first place.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_rebase_rebase">Rebase When You Rebase</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you <strong>do</strong> find yourself in a situation like this, Git has some further magic that might help you out.
If someone on your team force pushes changes that overwrite work that you&#8217;ve based work on, your challenge is to figure out what is yours and what they&#8217;ve rewritten.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It turns out that in addition to the commit SHA-1 checksum, Git also calculates a checksum that is based just on the patch introduced with the commit.
This is called a &#8220;patch-id&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you pull down work that was rewritten and rebase it on top of the new commits from your partner, Git can often successfully figure out what is uniquely yours and apply them back on top of the new branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For instance, in the previous scenario, if instead of doing a merge when we&#8217;re at <a href="#_pre_merge_rebase_work">Someone pushes rebased commits, abandoning commits you&#8217;ve based your work on</a> we run <code>git rebase teamone/master</code>, Git will:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Determine what work is unique to our branch (C2, C3, C4, C6, C7)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine which are not merge commits (C2, C3, C4)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Determine which have not been rewritten into the target branch (just C2 and C3, since C4 is the same patch as C4')</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Apply those commits to the top of <code>teamone/master</code></p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So instead of the result we see in <a href="#_merge_rebase_work">You merge in the same work again into a new merge commit</a>, we would end up with something more like <a href="#_rebase_rebase_work">Rebase on top of force-pushed rebase work.</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="_rebase_rebase_work" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/perils-of-rebasing-5.png" alt="Rebase on top of force-pushed rebase work.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 48. Rebase on top of force-pushed rebase work.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This only works if C4 and C4' that your partner made are almost exactly the same patch.
Otherwise the rebase won&#8217;t be able to tell that it&#8217;s a duplicate and will add another C4-like patch (which will probably fail to apply cleanly, since the changes would already be at least somewhat there).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also simplify this by running a <code>git pull --rebase</code> instead of a normal <code>git pull</code>.
Or you could do it manually with a <code>git fetch</code> followed by a <code>git rebase teamone/master</code> in this case.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using <code>git pull</code> and want to make <code>--rebase</code> the default, you can set the <code>pull.rebase</code> config value with something like <code>git config --global pull.rebase true</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you treat rebasing as a way to clean up and work with commits before you push them, and if you only rebase commits that have never been available publicly, then you&#8217;ll be fine.
If you rebase commits that have already been pushed publicly, and people may have based work on those commits, then you may be in for some frustrating trouble, and the scorn of your teammates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you or a partner does find it necessary at some point, make sure everyone knows to run <code>git pull --rebase</code> to try to make the pain after it happens a little bit simpler.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_rebase_vs_merge">Rebase vs. Merge</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Now that you&#8217;ve seen rebasing and merging in action, you may be wondering which one is better.
Before we can answer this, let&#8217;s step back a bit and talk about what history means.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One point of view on this is that your repository&#8217;s commit history is a <strong>record of what actually happened.</strong>
It&#8217;s a historical document, valuable in its own right, and shouldn&#8217;t be tampered with.
From this angle, changing the commit history is almost blasphemous; you&#8217;re <em>lying</em> about what actually transpired.
So what if there was a messy series of merge commits?
That&#8217;s how it happened, and the repository should preserve that for posterity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The opposing point of view is that the commit history is the <strong>story of how your project was made.</strong>
You wouldn&#8217;t publish the first draft of a book, and the manual for how to maintain your software deserves careful editing.
This is the camp that uses tools like rebase and filter-branch to tell the story in the way that&#8217;s best for future readers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, to the question of whether merging or rebasing is better: hopefully you&#8217;ll see that it&#8217;s not that simple.
Git is a powerful tool, and allows you to do many things to and with your history, but every team and every project is different.
Now that you know how both of these things work, it&#8217;s up to you to decide which one is best for your particular situation.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In general the way to get the best of both worlds is to rebase local changes you&#8217;ve made but haven&#8217;t shared yet before you push them in order to clean up your story, but never rebase anything you&#8217;ve pushed somewhere.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_summary_3">Summary</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ve covered basic branching and merging in Git.
You should feel comfortable creating and switching to new branches, switching between branches and merging local branches together.
You should also be able to share your branches by pushing them to a shared server, working with others on shared branches and rebasing your branches before they are shared.
Next, we&#8217;ll cover what you&#8217;ll need to run your own Git repository-hosting server.</p>

At this point, you should be able to do most of the day-to-day tasks for which you&#8217;ll be using Git.
However, in order to do any collaboration in Git, you&#8217;ll need to have a remote Git repository.
Although you can technically push changes to and pull changes from individuals' repositories, doing so is discouraged because you can fairly easily confuse what they&#8217;re working on if you&#8217;re not careful.
Furthermore, you want your collaborators to be able to access the repository even if your computer is offline – having a more reliable common repository is often useful.
Therefore, the preferred method for collaborating with someone is to set up an intermediate repository that you both have access to, and push to and pull from that.</p>

<p>Running a Git server is fairly straightforward.
First, you choose which protocols you want your server to communicate with.
The first section of this chapter will cover the available protocols and the pros and cons of each.
The next sections will explain some typical setups using those protocols and how to get your server running with them.
Last, we&#8217;ll go over a few hosted options, if you don&#8217;t mind hosting your code on someone else&#8217;s server and don&#8217;t want to go through the hassle of setting up and maintaining your own server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have no interest in running your own server, you can skip to the last section of the chapter to see some options for setting up a hosted account and then move on to the next chapter, where we discuss the various ins and outs of working in a distributed source control environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A remote repository is generally a <em>bare repository</em> – a Git repository that has no working directory.
Because the repository is only used as a collaboration point, there is no reason to have a snapshot checked out on disk; it&#8217;s just the Git data.
In the simplest terms, a bare repository is the contents of your project&#8217;s <code>.git</code> directory and nothing else.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_the_protocols">The Protocols</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git can use four major protocols to transfer data: Local, HTTP, Secure Shell (SSH) and Git.
Here we&#8217;ll discuss what they are and in what basic circumstances you would want (or not want) to use them.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_local_protocol">Local Protocol</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
The most basic is the <em>Local protocol</em>, in which the remote repository is in another directory on disk.
This is often used if everyone on your team has access to a shared filesystem such as an NFS mount, or in the less likely case that everyone logs in to the same computer.
The latter wouldn&#8217;t be ideal, because all your code repository instances would reside on the same computer, making a catastrophic loss much more likely.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have a shared mounted filesystem, then you can clone, push to, and pull from a local file-based repository.
To clone a repository like this or to add one as a remote to an existing project, use the path to the repository as the URL.
For example, to clone a local repository, you can run something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone /srv/git/project.git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or you can do this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone file:///srv/git/project.git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git operates slightly differently if you explicitly specify <code>file://</code> at the beginning of the URL.
If you just specify the path, Git tries to use hardlinks or directly copy the files it needs.
If you specify <code>file://</code>, Git fires up the processes that it normally uses to transfer data over a network which is generally a lot less efficient method of transferring the data.
The main reason to specify the <code>file://</code> prefix is if you want a clean copy of the repository with extraneous references or objects left out – generally after an import from another version-control system or something similar (see <a href="#_git_internals">Git Internals</a> for maintenance tasks).
We&#8217;ll use the normal path here because doing so is almost always faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To add a local repository to an existing Git project, you can run something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git remote add local_proj /srv/git/project.git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, you can push to and pull from that remote as though you were doing so over a network.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_pros">The Pros</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pros of file-based repositories are that they&#8217;re simple and they use existing file permissions and network access.
If you already have a shared filesystem to which your whole team has access, setting up a repository is very easy.
You stick the bare repository copy somewhere everyone has shared access to and set the read/write permissions as you would for any other shared directory.
We&#8217;ll discuss how to export a bare repository copy for this purpose in <a href="#_git_on_the_server">Getting Git on a Server</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is also a nice option for quickly grabbing work from someone else&#8217;s working repository.
If you and a co-worker are working on the same project and they want you to check something out, running a command like <code>git pull /home/john/project</code> is often easier than them pushing to a remote server and you pulling down.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_cons">The Cons</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The cons of this method are that shared access is generally more difficult to set up and reach from multiple locations than basic network access.
If you want to push from your laptop when you&#8217;re at home, you have to mount the remote disk, which can be difficult and slow compared to network-based access.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important to mention that this isn&#8217;t necessarily the fastest option if you&#8217;re using a shared mount of some kind.
A local repository is fast only if you have fast access to the data.
A repository on NFS is often slower than the repository over SSH on the same server, allowing Git to run off local disks on each system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, this protocol does not protect the repository against accidental damage.
Every user has full shell access to the "remote" directory, and there is nothing preventing them from changing or removing internal Git files and corrupting the repository.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_http_protocols">The HTTP Protocols</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git can communicate over HTTP in two different modes.
Prior to Git 1.6.6 there was only one way it could do this which was very simple and generally read-only.
In version 1.6.6 a new, smarter protocol was introduced that involved Git being able to intelligently negotiate data transfer in a manner similar to how it does over SSH.
In the last few years, this new HTTP protocol has become very popular since it&#8217;s simpler for the user and smarter about how it communicates.
The newer version is often referred to as the &#8220;Smart&#8221; HTTP protocol and the older way as &#8220;Dumb&#8221; HTTP.
We&#8217;ll cover the newer &#8220;smart&#8221; HTTP protocol first.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_smart_http">Smart HTTP</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
The &#8220;smart&#8221; HTTP protocol operates very similarly to the SSH or Git protocols but runs over standard HTTP/S ports and can use various HTTP authentication mechanisms, meaning it&#8217;s often easier on the user than something like SSH, since you can use things like username/password authentication rather than having to set up SSH keys.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It has probably become the most popular way to use Git now, since it can be set up to both serve anonymously like the <code>git://</code> protocol, and can also be pushed over with authentication and encryption like the SSH protocol.
Instead of having to set up different URLs for these things, you can now use a single URL for both.
If you try to push and the repository requires authentication (which it normally should), the server can prompt for a username and password.
The same goes for read access.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In fact, for services like GitHub, the URL you use to view the repository online (for example, &#8220;<a href="https://github.com/schacon/simplegit" class="bare">https://github.com/schacon/simplegit</a>&#8221;) is the same URL you can use to clone and, if you have access, push over.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_dumb_http">Dumb HTTP</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If the server does not respond with a Git HTTP smart service, the Git client will try to fall back to the simpler &#8220;dumb&#8221; HTTP protocol.
The Dumb protocol expects the bare Git repository to be served like normal files from the web server.
The beauty of the Dumb HTTP protocol is the simplicity of setting it up.
Basically, all you have to do is put a bare Git repository under your HTTP document root and set up a specific <code>post-update</code> hook, and you&#8217;re done (See <a href="#_git_hooks">Git Hooks</a>).
At that point, anyone who can access the web server under which you put the repository can also clone your repository.
To allow read access to your repository over HTTP, do something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd /var/www/htdocs/
$ git clone --bare /path/to/git_project gitproject.git
$ cd gitproject.git
$ mv hooks/post-update.sample hooks/post-update
$ chmod a+x hooks/post-update</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s all.
The <code>post-update</code> hook that comes with Git by default runs the appropriate command (<code>git update-server-info</code>) to make HTTP fetching and cloning work properly.
This command is run when you push to this repository (over SSH perhaps); then, other people can clone via something like</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone https://example.com/gitproject.git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this particular case, we&#8217;re using the <code>/var/www/htdocs</code> path that is common for Apache setups, but you can use any static web server – just put the bare repository in its path.
The Git data is served as basic static files (see <a href="#_git_internals">Git Internals</a> for details about exactly how it&#8217;s served).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally you would either choose to run a read/write Smart HTTP server or simply have the files accessible as read-only in the Dumb manner.
It&#8217;s rare to run a mix of the two services.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_pros_2">The Pros</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll concentrate on the pros of the Smart version of the HTTP protocol.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The simplicity of having a single URL for all types of access and having the server prompt only when authentication is needed makes things very easy for the end user.
Being able to authenticate with a username and password is also a big advantage over SSH, since users don&#8217;t have to generate SSH keys locally and upload their public key to the server before being able to interact with it.
For less sophisticated users, or users on systems where SSH is less common, this is a major advantage in usability.
It is also a very fast and efficient protocol, similar to the SSH one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also serve your repositories read-only over HTTPS, which means you can encrypt the content transfer; or you can go so far as to make the clients use specific signed SSL certificates.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another nice thing is that HTTP/S are such commonly used protocols that corporate firewalls are often set up to allow traffic through these ports.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_cons_2">The Cons</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git over HTTP/S can be a little more tricky to set up compared to SSH on some servers.
Other than that, there is very little advantage that other protocols have over the &#8220;Smart&#8221; HTTP protocol for serving Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re using HTTP for authenticated pushing, providing your credentials is sometimes more complicated than using keys over SSH.
There are however several credential caching tools you can use, including Keychain access on OSX and Credential Manager on Windows, to make this pretty painless.
Read <a href="#_credential_caching">Credential Storage</a> to see how to set up secure HTTP password caching on your system.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_ssh_protocol">The SSH Protocol</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
A common transport protocol for Git when self-hosting is over SSH.
This is because SSH access to servers is already set up in most places – and if it isn&#8217;t, it&#8217;s easy to do.
SSH is also an authenticated network protocol; and because it&#8217;s ubiquitous, it&#8217;s generally easy to set up and use.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To clone a Git repository over SSH, you can specify ssh:// URL like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone ssh://user@server/project.git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or you can use the shorter scp-like syntax for the SSH protocol:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone user@server:project.git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also not specify a user, and Git assumes the user you&#8217;re currently logged in as.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_pros_3">The Pros</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The pros of using SSH are many.
First, SSH is relatively easy to set up – SSH daemons are commonplace, many network admins have experience with them, and many OS distributions are set up with them or have tools to manage them.
Next, access over SSH is secure – all data transfer is encrypted and authenticated.
Last, like the HTTP/S, Git and Local protocols, SSH is efficient, making the data as compact as possible before transferring it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_cons_3">The Cons</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The negative aspect of SSH is that you can&#8217;t serve anonymous access of your repository over it.
People must have access to your machine over SSH to access it, even in a read-only capacity, which doesn&#8217;t make SSH access conducive to open source projects.
If you&#8217;re using it only within your corporate network, SSH may be the only protocol you need to deal with.
If you want to allow anonymous read-only access to your projects and also want to use SSH, you’ll have to set up SSH for you to push over but something else for others to fetch over.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_git_protocol">The Git Protocol</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Next is the Git protocol.
This is a special daemon that comes packaged with Git; it listens on a dedicated port (9418) that provides a service similar to the SSH protocol, but with absolutely no authentication.
In order for a repository to be served over the Git protocol, you must create the <code>git-daemon-export-ok</code> file – the daemon won&#8217;t serve a repository without that file in it – but other than that there is no security.
Either the Git repository is available for everyone to clone or it isn&#8217;t.
This means that there is generally no pushing over this protocol.
You can enable push access; but given the lack of authentication, if you turn on push access, anyone on the internet who finds your project&#8217;s URL could push to your project.
Suffice it to say that this is rare.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_pros_4">The Pros</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Git protocol is often the fastest network transfer protocol available.
If you’re serving a lot of traffic for a public project or serving a very large project that doesn&#8217;t require user authentication for read access, it’s likely that you&#8217;ll want to set up a Git daemon to serve your project.
It uses the same data-transfer mechanism as the SSH protocol but without the encryption and authentication overhead.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_cons_4">The Cons</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The downside of the Git protocol is the lack of authentication.
It&#8217;s generally undesirable for the Git protocol to be the only access to your project.
Generally, you&#8217;ll pair it with SSH or HTTPS access for the few developers who have push (write) access and have everyone else use <code>git://</code> for read-only access.
It&#8217;s also probably the most difficult protocol to set up.
It must run its own daemon, which requires <code>xinetd</code> configuration or the like, which isn&#8217;t always a walk in the park.
It also requires firewall access to port 9418, which isn&#8217;t a standard port that corporate firewalls always allow.
Behind big corporate firewalls, this obscure port is commonly blocked.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to initially set up any Git server, you have to export an existing repository into a new bare repository – a repository that doesn&#8217;t contain a working directory.
This is generally straightforward to do.
In order to clone your repository to create a new bare repository, you run the clone command with the <code>--bare</code> option.
By convention, bare repository directories end in <code>.git</code>, like so:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone --bare my_project my_project.git
Cloning into bare repository 'my_project.git'...
done.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should now have a copy of the Git directory data in your <code>my_project.git</code> directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is roughly equivalent to something like</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cp -Rf my_project/.git my_project.git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a couple of minor differences in the configuration file; but for your purpose, this is close to the same thing.
It takes the Git repository by itself, without a working directory, and creates a directory specifically for it alone.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_bare_repo">Putting the Bare Repository on a Server</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you have a bare copy of your repository, all you need to do is put it on a server and set up your protocols.
Let&#8217;s say you&#8217;ve set up a server called <code>git.example.com</code> that you have SSH access to, and you want to store all your Git repositories under the <code>/srv/git</code> directory.
Assuming that <code>/srv/git</code> exists on that server, you can set up your new repository by copying your bare repository over:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ scp -r my_project.git user@git.example.com:/srv/git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, other users who have SSH access to the same server which has read-access to the <code>/srv/git</code> directory can clone your repository by running</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone user@git.example.com:/srv/git/my_project.git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If a user SSHs into a server and has write access to the <code>/srv/git/my_project.git</code> directory, they will also automatically have push access.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git will automatically add group write permissions to a repository properly if you run the <code>git init</code> command with the <code>--shared</code> option.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You see how easy it is to take a Git repository, create a bare version, and place it on a server to which you and your collaborators have SSH access.
Now you&#8217;re ready to collaborate on the same project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this is literally all you need to do to run a useful Git server to which several people have access – just add SSH-able accounts on a server, and stick a bare repository somewhere that all those users have read and write access to.
You&#8217;re ready to go – nothing else needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the next few sections, you&#8217;ll see how to expand to more sophisticated setups.
This discussion will include not having to create user accounts for each user, adding public read access to repositories, setting up web UIs and more.
However, keep in mind that to collaborate with a couple of people on a private project, all you <em>need</em> is an SSH server and a bare repository.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_small_setups">Small Setups</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re a small outfit or are just trying out Git in your organization and have only a few developers, things can be simple for you.
One of the most complicated aspects of setting up a Git server is user management.
If you want some repositories to be read-only to certain users and read/write to others, access and permissions can be a bit more difficult to arrange.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_ssh_access">SSH Access</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If you have a server to which all your developers already have SSH access, it&#8217;s generally easiest to set up your first repository there, because you have to do almost no work (as we covered in the last section).
If you want more complex access control type permissions on your repositories, you can handle them with the normal filesystem permissions of the operating system your server runs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to place your repositories on a server that doesn&#8217;t have accounts for everyone on your team whom you want to have write access, then you must set up SSH access for them.
We assume that if you have a server with which to do this, you already have an SSH server installed, and that&#8217;s how you&#8217;re accessing the server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a few ways you can give access to everyone on your team.
The first is to set up accounts for everybody, which is straightforward but can be cumbersome.
You may not want to run <code>adduser</code> and set temporary passwords for every user.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A second method is to create a single <em>git</em> user on the machine, ask every user who is to have write access to send you an SSH public key, and add that key to the <code>~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code> file of your new <em>git</em> user.
At that point, everyone will be able to access that machine via the <em>git</em> user.
This doesn&#8217;t affect the commit data in any way – the SSH user you connect as doesn&#8217;t affect the commits you&#8217;ve recorded.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another way to do it is to have your SSH server authenticate from an LDAP server or some other centralized authentication source that you may already have set up.
As long as each user can get shell access on the machine, any SSH authentication mechanism you can think of should work.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_generate_ssh_key">Generating Your SSH Public Key</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
That being said, many Git servers authenticate using SSH public keys.
In order to provide a public key, each user in your system must generate one if they don&#8217;t already have one.
This process is similar across all operating systems.
First, you should check to make sure you don&#8217;t already have a key.
By default, a user&#8217;s SSH keys are stored in that user&#8217;s <code>~/.ssh</code> directory.
You can easily check to see if you have a key already by going to that directory and listing the contents:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ls
authorized_keys2  id_dsa       known_hosts
config            id_dsa.pub</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;re looking for a pair of files named something like <code>id_dsa</code> or <code>id_rsa</code> and a matching file with a <code>.pub</code> extension.
The <code>.pub</code> file is your public key, and the other file is your private key.
If you don&#8217;t have these files (or you don&#8217;t even have a <code>.ssh</code> directory), you can create them by running a program called <code>ssh-keygen</code>, which is provided with the SSH package on Linux/Mac systems and comes with Git for Windows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ ssh-keygen
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/home/schacon/.ssh/id_rsa):
Created directory '/home/schacon/.ssh'.
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /home/schacon/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /home/schacon/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
d0:82:24:8e:d7:f1:bb:9b:33:53:96:93:49:da:9b:e3 schacon@mylaptop.local</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First it confirms where you want to save the key (<code>.ssh/id_rsa</code>), and then it asks twice for a passphrase, which you can leave empty if you don&#8217;t want to type a password when you use the key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, each user that does this has to send their public key to you or whoever is administrating the Git server (assuming you&#8217;re using an SSH server setup that requires public keys).
All they have to do is copy the contents of the <code>.pub</code> file and email it.
The public keys look something like this:</p>

<h3 id="_setting_up_server">Setting Up the Server</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s walk through setting up SSH access on the server side.
In this example, you&#8217;ll use the <code>authorized_keys</code> method for authenticating your users.
We also assume you&#8217;re running a standard Linux distribution like Ubuntu.
First, you create a <code>git</code> user and a <code>.ssh</code> directory for that user.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo adduser git
$ su git
$ cd
$ mkdir .ssh &amp;&amp; chmod 700 .ssh
$ touch .ssh/authorized_keys &amp;&amp; chmod 600 .ssh/authorized_keys</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, you need to add some developer SSH public keys to the <code>authorized_keys</code> file for the <code>git</code> user.
Let&#8217;s assume you have some trusted public keys and have saved them to temporary files.
Again, the public keys look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.john.pub
ssh-rsa AAAAB3NzaC1yc2EAAAADAQABAAABAQCB007n/ww+ouN4gSLKssMxXnBOvf9LGt4L

dAv8JggJICUvax2T9va5 gsg-keypair</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You just append them to the <code>git</code> user&#8217;s <code>authorized_keys</code> file in its <code>.ssh</code> directory:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.john.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.josie.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys
$ cat /tmp/id_rsa.jessica.pub &gt;&gt; ~/.ssh/authorized_keys</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, you can set up an empty repository for them by running <code>git init</code> with the <code>--bare</code> option, which initializes the repository without a working directory:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd /srv/git
$ mkdir project.git
$ cd project.git
$ git init --bare
Initialized empty Git repository in /srv/git/project.git/</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, John, Josie, or Jessica can push the first version of their project into that repository by adding it as a remote and pushing up a branch.
Note that someone must shell onto the machine and create a bare repository every time you want to add a project.
Let&#8217;s use <code>gitserver</code> as the hostname of the server on which you&#8217;ve set up your <code>git</code> user and repository.
If you&#8217;re running it internally, and you set up DNS for <code>gitserver</code> to point to that server, then you can use the commands pretty much as is (assuming that <code>myproject</code> is an existing project with files in it):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"># on John's computer
$ cd myproject
$ git init
$ git add .
$ git commit -m 'initial commit'
$ git remote add origin git@gitserver:/srv/git/project.git
$ git push origin master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, the others can clone it down and push changes back up just as easily:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone git@gitserver:/srv/git/project.git
$ cd project
$ vim README
$ git commit -am 'fix for the README file'
$ git push origin master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With this method, you can quickly get a read/write Git server up and running for a handful of developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should note that currently all these users can also log into the server and get a shell as the <code>git</code> user.
If you want to restrict that, you will have to change the shell to something else in the <code>passwd</code> file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can easily restrict the <code>git</code> user to only doing Git activities with a limited shell tool called <code>git-shell</code> that comes with Git.
If you set this as your <code>git</code> user&#8217;s login shell, then the <code>git</code> user can&#8217;t have normal shell access to your server.
To use this, specify <code>git-shell</code> instead of bash or csh for your user&#8217;s login shell.
To do so, you must first add <code>git-shell</code> to <code>/etc/shells</code> if it&#8217;s not already there:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat /etc/shells   # see if `git-shell` is already in there.  If not...
$ which git-shell   # make sure git-shell is installed on your system.
$ sudo vim /etc/shells  # and add the path to git-shell from last command</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you can edit the shell for a user using <code>chsh &lt;username&gt; -s &lt;shell&gt;</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo chsh git -s $(which git-shell)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, the <code>git</code> user can only use the SSH connection to push and pull Git repositories and can&#8217;t shell onto the machine.
If you try, you&#8217;ll see a login rejection like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ ssh git@gitserver
fatal: Interactive git shell is not enabled.
hint: ~/git-shell-commands should exist and have read and execute access.
Connection to gitserver closed.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now Git network commands will still work just fine but the users won&#8217;t be able to get a shell.
As the output states, you can also set up a directory in the <code>git</code> user&#8217;s home directory that customizes the <code>git-shell</code> command a bit.
For instance, you can restrict the Git commands that the server will accept or you can customize the message that users see if they try to SSH in like that.
Run <code>git help shell</code> for more information on customizing the shell.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_git_daemon">Git Daemon</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Next we&#8217;ll set up a daemon serving repositories over the &#8220;Git&#8221; protocol.
This is common choice for fast, unauthenticated access to your Git data.
Remember that since it&#8217;s not an authenticated service, anything you serve over this protocol is public within its network.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re running this on a server outside your firewall, it should only be used for projects that are publicly visible to the world.
If the server you&#8217;re running it on is inside your firewall, you might use it for projects that a large number of people or computers (continuous integration or build servers) have read-only access to, when you don&#8217;t want to have to add an SSH key for each.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In any case, the Git protocol is relatively easy to set up.
Basically, you need to run this command in a daemonized manner:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git daemon --reuseaddr --base-path=/srv/git/ /srv/git/</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>--reuseaddr</code> allows the server to restart without waiting for old connections to time out, the <code>--base-path</code> option allows people to clone projects without specifying the entire path, and the path at the end tells the Git daemon where to look for repositories to export.
If you&#8217;re running a firewall, you&#8217;ll also need to punch a hole in it at port 9418 on the box you&#8217;re setting this up on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can daemonize this process a number of ways, depending on the operating system you&#8217;re running.
On an Ubuntu machine, you can use an Upstart script.
So, in the following file</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">/etc/init/local-git-daemon.conf</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>you put this script:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">start on startup
stop on shutdown
exec /usr/bin/git daemon \
    --user=git --group=git \
    --reuseaddr \
    --base-path=/srv/git/ \
    /srv/git/
respawn</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For security reasons, it is strongly encouraged to have this daemon run as a user with read-only permissions to the repositories – you can easily do this by creating a new user <em>git-ro</em> and running the daemon as them.
For the sake of simplicity we&#8217;ll simply run it as the same <em>git</em> user that <code>git-shell</code> is running as.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you restart your machine, your Git daemon will start automatically and respawn if it goes down.
To get it running without having to reboot, you can run this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ initctl start local-git-daemon</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On other systems, you may want to use <code>xinetd</code>, a script in your <code>sysvinit</code> system, or something else – as long as you get that command daemonized and watched somehow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, you have to tell Git which repositories to allow unauthenticated Git server-based access to.
You can do this in each repository by creating a file named <code>git-daemon-export-ok</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd /path/to/project.git
$ touch git-daemon-export-ok</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The presence of that file tells Git that it&#8217;s OK to serve this project without authentication.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_smart_http_2">Smart HTTP</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
We now have authenticated access through SSH and unauthenticated access through <code>git://</code>, but there is also a protocol that can do both at the same time.
Setting up Smart HTTP is basically just enabling a CGI script that is provided with Git called <code>git-http-backend</code> on the server.
This CGI will read the path and headers sent by a <code>git fetch</code> or <code>git push</code> to an HTTP URL and determine if the client can communicate over HTTP (which is true for any client since version 1.6.6).
If the CGI sees that the client is smart, it will communicate smartly with it, otherwise it will fall back to the dumb behavior (so it is backward compatible for reads with older clients).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s walk through a very basic setup.
We&#8217;ll set this up with Apache as the CGI server.
If you don&#8217;t have Apache setup, you can do so on a Linux box with something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo apt-get install apache2 apache2-utils
$ a2enmod cgi alias env</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This also enables the <code>mod_cgi</code>, <code>mod_alias</code>, and <code>mod_env</code> modules, which are all needed for this to work properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ll also need to set the Unix user group of the <code>/srv/git</code> directories to <code>www-data</code> so your web server can read- and write-access the repositories, because the Apache instance running the CGI script will (by default) be running as that user:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ chgrp -R www-data /srv/git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next we need to add some things to the Apache configuration to run the <code>git-http-backend</code> as the handler for anything coming into the <code>/git</code> path of your web server.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">SetEnv GIT_PROJECT_ROOT /srv/git
SetEnv GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL
ScriptAlias /git/ /usr/lib/git-core/git-http-backend/</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you leave out <code>GIT_HTTP_EXPORT_ALL</code> environment variable, then Git will only serve to unauthenticated clients the repositories with the <code>git-daemon-export-ok</code> file in them, just like the Git daemon did.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally you&#8217;ll want to tell Apache to allow requests to <code>git-http-backend</code> and make writes be authenticated somehow, possibly with an Auth block like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">&lt;Files "git-http-backend"&gt;
    AuthType Basic
    AuthName "Git Access"
    AuthUserFile /srv/git/.htpasswd
    Require expr !(%{QUERY_STRING} -strmatch '*service=git-receive-pack*' || %{REQUEST_URI} =~ m#/git-receive-pack$#)
    Require valid-user
&lt;/Files&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That will require you to create a <code>.htpasswd</code> file containing the passwords of all the valid users.
Here is an example of adding a &#8220;schacon&#8221; user to the file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ htpasswd -c /srv/git/.htpasswd schacon</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are tons of ways to have Apache authenticate users, you&#8217;ll have to choose and implement one of them.
This is just the simplest example we could come up with.
You&#8217;ll also almost certainly want to set this up over SSL so all this data is encrypted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We don&#8217;t want to go too far down the rabbit hole of Apache configuration specifics, since you could well be using a different server or have different authentication needs.
The idea is that Git comes with a CGI called <code>git-http-backend</code> that when invoked will do all the negotiation to send and receive data over HTTP.
It does not implement any authentication itself, but that can easily be controlled at the layer of the web server that invokes it.
You can do this with nearly any CGI-capable web server, so go with the one that you know best.</p>

<h3 id="_gitweb">GitWeb</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Now that you have basic read/write and read-only access to your project, you may want to set up a simple web-based visualizer.
Git comes with a CGI script called GitWeb that is sometimes used for this.</p>
</div>
<div id="gitweb" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/git-instaweb.png" alt="The GitWeb web-based user interface.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 49. The GitWeb web-based user interface.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to check out what GitWeb would look like for your project, Git comes with a command to fire up a temporary instance if you have a lightweight server on your system like <code>lighttpd</code> or <code>webrick</code>.
On Linux machines, <code>lighttpd</code> is often installed, so you may be able to get it to run by typing <code>git instaweb</code> in your project directory.
If you&#8217;re running a Mac, Leopard comes preinstalled with Ruby, so <code>webrick</code> may be your best bet.
To start <code>instaweb</code> with a non-lighttpd handler, you can run it with the <code>--httpd</code> option.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git instaweb --httpd=webrick
[2009-02-21 10:02:21] INFO  WEBrick 1.3.1
[2009-02-21 10:02:21] INFO  ruby 1.8.6 (2008-03-03) [universal-darwin9.0]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That starts up an HTTPD server on port 1234 and then automatically starts a web browser that opens on that page.
It&#8217;s pretty easy on your part.
When you&#8217;re done and want to shut down the server, you can run the same command with the <code>--stop</code> option:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git instaweb --httpd=webrick --stop</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to run the web interface on a server all the time for your team or for an open source project you&#8217;re hosting, you&#8217;ll need to set up the CGI script to be served by your normal web server.
Some Linux distributions have a <code>gitweb</code> package that you may be able to install via <code>apt</code> or <code>yum</code>, so you may want to try that first.
We&#8217;ll walk through installing GitWeb manually very quickly.
First, you need to get the Git source code, which GitWeb comes with, and generate the custom CGI script:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone git://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/git/git.git
$ cd git/
$ make GITWEB_PROJECTROOT="/srv/git" prefix=/usr gitweb
    SUBDIR gitweb
    SUBDIR ../
make[2]: `GIT-VERSION-FILE' is up to date.
    GEN gitweb.cgi
    GEN static/gitweb.js
$ sudo cp -Rf gitweb /var/www/</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that you have to tell the command where to find your Git repositories with the <code>GITWEB_PROJECTROOT</code> variable.
Now, you need to make Apache use CGI for that script, for which you can add a VirtualHost:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">&lt;VirtualHost *:80&gt;
    ServerName gitserver
    DocumentRoot /var/www/gitweb
    &lt;Directory /var/www/gitweb&gt;
        Options ExecCGI +FollowSymLinks +SymLinksIfOwnerMatch
        AllowOverride All
        order allow,deny
        Allow from all
        AddHandler cgi-script cgi
        DirectoryIndex gitweb.cgi
    &lt;/Directory&gt;
&lt;/VirtualHost&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, GitWeb can be served with any CGI or Perl capable web server; if you prefer to use something else, it shouldn&#8217;t be difficult to set up.
At this point, you should be able to visit <code>http://gitserver/</code> to view your repositories online.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_gitlab">GitLab</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
GitWeb is pretty simplistic though.
If you&#8217;re looking for a more modern, fully featured Git server, there are some several open source solutions out there that you can install instead.
As GitLab is one of the more popular ones, we&#8217;ll cover installing and using it as an example.
This is a bit more complex than the GitWeb option and likely requires more maintenance, but it is a much more fully featured option.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_installation">Installation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GitLab is a database-backed web application, so its installation is a bit more involved than some other Git servers.
Fortunately, this process is very well-documented and supported.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a few methods you can pursue to install GitLab.
To get something up and running quickly, you can download a virtual machine image or a one-click installer from <a href="https://bitnami.com/stack/gitlab" class="bare">https://bitnami.com/stack/gitlab</a>, and tweak the configuration to match your particular environment.
One nice touch Bitnami has included is the login screen (accessed by typing alt-&rarr;); it tells you the IP address and default username and password for the installed GitLab.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 50. The Bitnami GitLab virtual machine login screen.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For anything else, follow the guidance in the GitLab Community Edition readme, which can be found at <a href="https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/tree/master" class="bare">https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab-ce/tree/master</a>.
There you&#8217;ll find assistance for installing GitLab using Chef recipes, a virtual machine on Digital Ocean, and RPM and DEB packages (which, as of this writing, are in beta).
There&#8217;s also &#8220;unofficial&#8221; guidance on getting GitLab running with non-standard operating systems and databases, a fully-manual installation script, and many other topics.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_administration">Administration</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GitLab&#8217;s administration interface is accessed over the web.
Simply point your browser to the hostname or IP address where GitLab is installed, and log in as an admin user.
The default username is <code>admin@local.host</code>, and the default password is <code>5iveL!fe</code> (which you will be prompted to change as soon as you enter it).
Once logged in, click the &#8220;Admin area&#8221; icon in the menu at the top right.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_users">Users</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Users in GitLab are accounts that correspond to people.
User accounts don&#8217;t have a lot of complexity; mainly it&#8217;s a collection of personal information attached to login data.
Each user account comes with a <strong>namespace</strong>, which is a logical grouping of projects that belong to that user.
If the user <code>jane</code> had a project named <code>project</code>, that project&#8217;s url would be <a href="http://server/jane/project" class="bare">http://server/jane/project</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Removing a user can be done in two ways.
&#8220;Blocking&#8221; a user prevents them from logging into the GitLab instance, but all of the data under that user&#8217;s namespace will be preserved, and commits signed with that user&#8217;s email address will still link back to their profile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>&#8220;Destroying&#8221; a user, on the other hand, completely removes them from the database and filesystem.
All projects and data in their namespace is removed, and any groups they own will also be removed.
This is obviously a much more permanent and destructive action, and its uses are rare.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_gitlab_groups_section">Groups</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A GitLab group is an assemblage of projects, along with data about how users can access those projects.
Each group has a project namespace (the same way that users do), so if the group <code>training</code> has a project <code>materials</code>, its url would be <a href="http://server/training/materials" class="bare">http://server/training/materials</a>.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 53. The GitLab group administration screen.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each group is associated with a number of users, each of which has a level of permissions for the group&#8217;s projects and the group itself.
These range from &#8220;Guest&#8221; (issues and chat only) to &#8220;Owner&#8221; (full control of the group, its members, and its projects).
The types of permissions are too numerous to list here, but GitLab has a helpful link on the administration screen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_projects">Projects</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A GitLab project roughly corresponds to a single Git repository.
Every project belongs to a single namespace, either a user or a group.
If the project belongs to a user, the owner of the project has direct control over who has access to the project; if the project belongs to a group, the group&#8217;s user-level permissions will also take effect.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every project also has a visibility level, which controls who has read access to that project&#8217;s pages and repository.
If a project is <em>Private</em>, the project&#8217;s owner must explicitly grant access to specific users.
An <em>Internal</em> project is visible to any logged-in user, and a <em>Public</em> project is visible to anyone.
Note that this controls both <code>git fetch</code> access as well as access to the web UI for that project.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_hooks">Hooks</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GitLab includes support for hooks, both at a project or system level.
For either of these, the GitLab server will perform an HTTP POST with some descriptive JSON whenever relevant events occur.
This is a great way to connect your Git repositories and GitLab instance to the rest of your development automation, such as CI servers, chat rooms, or deployment tools.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_basic_usage">Basic Usage</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll want to do with GitLab is create a new project.
This is accomplished by clicking the &#8220;+&#8221; icon on the toolbar.
You&#8217;ll be asked for the project&#8217;s name, which namespace it should belong to, and what its visibility level should be.
Most of what you specify here isn&#8217;t permanent, and can be re-adjusted later through the settings interface.
Click &#8220;Create Project&#8221;, and you&#8217;re done.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the project exists, you&#8217;ll probably want to connect it with a local Git repository.
Each project is accessible over HTTPS or SSH, either of which can be used to configure a Git remote.
The URLs are visible at the top of the project&#8217;s home page.
For an existing local repository, this command will create a remote named <code>gitlab</code> to the hosted location:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git remote add gitlab https://server/namespace/project.git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don&#8217;t have a local copy of the repository, you can simply do this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone https://server/namespace/project.git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The web UI provides access to several useful views of the repository itself.
Each project&#8217;s home page shows recent activity, and links along the top will lead you to views of the project&#8217;s files and commit log.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_working_together">Working Together</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The simplest way of working together on a GitLab project is by giving another user direct push access to the Git repository.
You can add a user to a project by going to the &#8220;Members&#8221; section of that project&#8217;s settings, and associating the new user with an access level (the different access levels are discussed a bit in <a href="#_gitlab_groups_section">Groups</a>).
By giving a user an access level of &#8220;Developer&#8221; or above, that user can push commits and branches directly to the repository with impunity.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another, more decoupled way of collaboration is by using merge requests.
This feature enables any user that can see a project to contribute to it in a controlled way.
Users with direct access can simply create a branch, push commits to it, and open a merge request from their branch back into <code>master</code> or any other branch.
Users who don&#8217;t have push permissions for a repository can &#8220;fork&#8221; it (create their own copy), push commits to <em>that</em> copy, and open a merge request from their fork back to the main project.
This model allows the owner to be in full control of what goes into the repository and when, while allowing contributions from untrusted users.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Merge requests and issues are the main units of long-lived discussion in GitLab.
Each merge request allows a line-by-line discussion of the proposed change (which supports a lightweight kind of code review), as well as a general overall discussion thread.
Both can be assigned to users, or organized into milestones.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section is focused mainly on the Git-related features of GitLab, but as a mature project, it provides many other features to help your team work together, such as project wikis and system maintenance tools.
One benefit to GitLab is that, once the server is set up and running, you&#8217;ll rarely need to tweak a configuration file or access the server via SSH; most administration and general usage can be accomplished through the in-browser interface.</p>

<h3 id="_third_party_hosted_options">Third Party Hosted Options</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don&#8217;t want to go through all of the work involved in setting up your own Git server, you have several options for hosting your Git projects on an external dedicated hosting site.
Doing so offers a number of advantages: a hosting site is generally quick to set up and easy to start projects on, and no server maintenance or monitoring is involved.
Even if you set up and run your own server internally, you may still want to use a public hosting site for your open source code – it&#8217;s generally easier for the open source community to find and help you with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These days, you have a huge number of hosting options to choose from, each with different advantages and disadvantages.
To see an up-to-date list, check out the GitHosting page on the main Git wiki at <a href="https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitHosting" class="bare">https://git.wiki.kernel.org/index.php/GitHosting</a></p>

<p>We&#8217;ll cover using GitHub in detail in <a href="#_github">GitHub</a>, as it is the largest Git host out there and you may need to interact with projects hosted on it in any case, but there are dozens more to choose from should you not want to set up your own Git server.</p>

<h3 id="_summary_4">Summary</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have several options to get a remote Git repository up and running so that you can collaborate with others or share your work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Running your own server gives you a lot of control and allows you to run the server within your own firewall, but such a server generally requires a fair amount of your time to set up and maintain.
If you place your data on a hosted server, it&#8217;s easy to set up and maintain; however, you have to be able to keep your code on someone else&#8217;s servers, and some organizations don&#8217;t allow that.</p>

<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Now that you have a remote Git repository set up as a point for all the developers to share their code, and you&#8217;re familiar with basic Git commands in a local workflow, you&#8217;ll look at how to utilize some of the distributed workflows that Git affords you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this chapter, you&#8217;ll see how to work with Git in a distributed environment as a contributor and an integrator.
That is, you&#8217;ll learn how to contribute code successfully to a project and make it as easy on you and the project maintainer as possible, and also how to maintain a project successfully with a number of developers contributing.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_distributed_workflows">Distributed Workflows</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Unlike Centralized Version Control Systems (CVCSs), the distributed nature of Git allows you to be far more flexible in how developers collaborate on projects.
In centralized systems, every developer is a node working more or less equally on a central hub.
In Git, however, every developer is potentially both a node and a hub – that is, every developer can both contribute code to other repositories and maintain a public repository on which others can base their work and which they can contribute to.
This opens a vast range of workflow possibilities for your project and/or your team, so we&#8217;ll cover a few common paradigms that take advantage of this flexibility.
We&#8217;ll go over the strengths and possible weaknesses of each design; you can choose a single one to use, or you can mix and match features from each.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_centralized_workflow">Centralized Workflow</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
In centralized systems, there is generally a single collaboration model–the centralized workflow.
One central hub, or repository, can accept code, and everyone synchronizes their work to it.
A number of developers are nodes – consumers of that hub – and synchronize to that one place.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/centralized_workflow.png" alt="Centralized workflow.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 54. Centralized workflow.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This means that if two developers clone from the hub and both make changes, the first developer to push their changes back up can do so with no problems.
The second developer must merge in the first one&#8217;s work before pushing changes up, so as not to overwrite the first developer&#8217;s changes.
This concept is as true in Git as it is in Subversion (or any CVCS), and this model works perfectly well in Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are already comfortable with a centralized workflow in your company or team, you can easily continue using that workflow with Git.
Simply set up a single repository, and give everyone on your team push access; Git won&#8217;t let users overwrite each other.
Say John and Jessica both start working at the same time.
John finishes his change and pushes it to the server.
Then Jessica tries to push her changes, but the server rejects them.
She is told that she&#8217;s trying to push non-fast-forward changes and that she won&#8217;t be able to do so until she fetches and merges.
This workflow is attractive to a lot of people because it&#8217;s a paradigm that many are familiar and comfortable with.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is also not limited to small teams.
With Git&#8217;s branching model, it&#8217;s possible for hundreds of developers to successfully work on a single project through dozens of branches simultaneously.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_integration_manager">Integration-Manager Workflow</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Because Git allows you to have multiple remote repositories, it&#8217;s possible to have a workflow where each developer has write access to their own public repository and read access to everyone else&#8217;s.
This scenario often includes a canonical repository that represents the &#8220;official&#8221; project.
To contribute to that project, you create your own public clone of the project and push your changes to it.
Then, you can send a request to the maintainer of the main project to pull in your changes.
The maintainer can then add your repository as a remote, test your changes locally, merge them into their branch, and push back to their repository.
The process works as follows (see <a href="#wfdiag_b">Integration-manager workflow.</a>):</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The project maintainer pushes to their public repository.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A contributor clones that repository and makes changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contributor pushes to their own public copy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The contributor sends the maintainer an email asking them to pull changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maintainer adds the contributor&#8217;s repo as a remote and merges locally.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The maintainer pushes merged changes to the main repository.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 55. Integration-manager workflow.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
This is a very common workflow with hub-based tools like GitHub or GitLab, where it&#8217;s easy to fork a project and push your changes into your fork for everyone to see.
One of the main advantages of this approach is that you can continue to work, and the maintainer of the main repository can pull in your changes at any time.
Contributors don&#8217;t have to wait for the project to incorporate their changes – each party can work at their own pace.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_dictator_and_lieutenants_workflow">Dictator and Lieutenants Workflow</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
This is a variant of a multiple-repository workflow.
It&#8217;s generally used by huge projects with hundreds of collaborators; one famous example is the Linux kernel.
Various integration managers are in charge of certain parts of the repository; they&#8217;re called lieutenants.
All the lieutenants have one integration manager known as the benevolent dictator.
The benevolent dictator pushes from his directory to a reference repository from which all the collaborators need to pull.
The process works like this (see <a href="#wfdiag_c">Benevolent dictator workflow.</a>):</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Regular developers work on their topic branch and rebase their work on top of <code>master</code>.
The <code>master</code> branch is that of the reference directory to which the dictator pushes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Lieutenants merge the developers' topic branches into their <code>master</code> branch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dictator merges the lieutenants' <code>master</code> branches into their <code>master</code> branch.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The dictator pushes their <code>master</code> to the reference repository so the other developers can rebase on it.</p>
</li>
</ol>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This kind of workflow isn&#8217;t common, but can be useful in very big projects, or in highly hierarchical environments.
It allows the project leader (the dictator) to delegate much of the work and collect large subsets of code at multiple points before integrating them.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_workflows_summary">Workflows Summary</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are some commonly used workflows that are possible with a distributed system like Git, but you can see that many variations are possible to suit your particular real-world workflow.
Now that you can (hopefully) determine which workflow combination may work for you, we&#8217;ll cover some more specific examples of how to accomplish the main roles that make up the different flows.
In the next section, you&#8217;ll learn about a few common patterns for contributing to a project.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_contributing_project">Contributing to a Project</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
The main difficulty with describing how to contribute to a project is that there are a huge number of variations on how it&#8217;s done.
Because Git is very flexible, people can and do work together in many ways, and it&#8217;s problematic to describe how you should contribute – every project is a bit different.
Some of the variables involved are active contributor count, chosen workflow, your commit access, and possibly the external contribution method.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first variable is active contributor count – how many users are actively contributing code to this project, and how often?
In many instances, you&#8217;ll have two or three developers with a few commits a day, or possibly less for somewhat dormant projects.
For larger companies or projects, the number of developers could be in the thousands, with hundreds or thousands of commits coming in each day.
This is important because with more and more developers, you run into more issues with making sure your code applies cleanly or can be easily merged.
Changes you submit may be rendered obsolete or severely broken by work that is merged in while you were working or while your changes were waiting to be approved or applied.
How can you keep your code consistently up to date and your commits valid?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next variable is the workflow in use for the project.
Is it centralized, with each developer having equal write access to the main codeline?
Does the project have a maintainer or integration manager who checks all the patches?
Are all the patches peer-reviewed and approved?
Are you involved in that process?
Is a lieutenant system in place, and do you have to submit your work to them first?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next variable is your commit access.
The workflow required in order to contribute to a project is much different if you have write access to the project than if you don&#8217;t.
If you don&#8217;t have write access, how does the project prefer to accept contributed work?
Does it even have a policy?
How much work are you contributing at a time?
How often do you contribute?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All these questions can affect how you contribute effectively to a project and what workflows are preferred or available to you.
We&#8217;ll cover aspects of each of these in a series of use cases, moving from simple to more complex; you should be able to construct the specific workflows you need in practice from these examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_commit_guidelines">Commit Guidelines</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before we start looking at the specific use cases, here&#8217;s a quick note about commit messages.
Having a good guideline for creating commits and sticking to it makes working with Git and collaborating with others a lot easier.
The Git project provides a document that lays out a number of good tips for creating commits from which to submit patches – you can read it in the Git source code in the <code>Documentation/SubmittingPatches</code> file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
First, you don&#8217;t want to submit any whitespace errors.
Git provides an easy way to check for this – before you commit, run <code>git diff --check</code>, which identifies possible whitespace errors and lists them for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/git-diff-check.png" alt="Output of `git diff --check`.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 57. Output of <code>git diff --check</code>.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you run that command before committing, you can tell if you&#8217;re about to commit whitespace issues that may annoy other developers.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, try to make each commit a logically separate changeset.
If you can, try to make your changes digestible – don&#8217;t code for a whole weekend on five different issues and then submit them all as one massive commit on Monday.
Even if you don&#8217;t commit during the weekend, use the staging area on Monday to split your work into at least one commit per issue, with a useful message per commit.
If some of the changes modify the same file, try to use <code>git add --patch</code> to partially stage files (covered in detail in <a href="#_interactive_staging">Interactive Staging</a>).
The project snapshot at the tip of the branch is identical whether you do one commit or five, as long as all the changes are added at some point, so try to make things easier on your fellow developers when they have to review your changes.
This approach also makes it easier to pull out or revert one of the changesets if you need to later.
<a href="#_rewriting_history">Rewriting History</a> describes a number of useful Git tricks for rewriting history and interactively staging files – use these tools to help craft a clean and understandable history before sending the work to someone else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last thing to keep in mind is the commit message.
Getting in the habit of creating quality commit messages makes using and collaborating with Git a lot easier.
As a general rule, your messages should start with a single line that&#8217;s no more than about 50 characters and that describes the changeset concisely, followed by a blank line, followed by a more detailed explanation.
The Git project requires that the more detailed explanation include your motivation for the change and contrast its implementation with previous behavior – this is a good guideline to follow.
It&#8217;s also a good idea to use the imperative present tense in these messages.
In other words, use commands.
Instead of &#8220;I added tests for&#8221; or &#8220;Adding tests for,&#8221; use &#8220;Add tests for.&#8221;
Here is a <a href="http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html">template originally written by Tim Pope</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">Short (50 chars or less) summary of changes

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary.  Wrap it to
about 72 characters or so.  In some contexts, the first
line is treated as the subject of an email and the rest of
the text as the body.  The blank line separating the
summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body
entirely); tools like rebase can get confused if you run
the two together.

Further paragraphs come after blank lines.

  - Bullet points are okay, too

  - Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet,
    preceded by a single space, with blank lines in
    between, but conventions vary here</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If all your commit messages look like this, things will be a lot easier for you and the developers you work with.
The Git project has well-formatted commit messages – try running <code>git log --no-merges</code> there to see what a nicely formatted project-commit history looks like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the sake of brevity, the following examples, and most examples in other parts of this book,  don&#8217;t have nicely-formatted messages like this; instead, we use the <code>-m</code> option to <code>git commit</code>.
Do as we say, not as we do.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_private_team">Private Small Team</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
The simplest setup you&#8217;re likely to encounter is a private project with one or two other developers.
&#8220;Private,&#8221; in this context, means closed-source – not accessible to the outside world.
You and the other developers all have push access to the repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this environment, you can follow a workflow similar to what you might do when using Subversion or another centralized system.
You still get the advantages of things like offline committing and vastly simpler branching and merging, but the workflow can be very similar; the main difference is that merges happen client-side rather than on the server at commit time.
Let&#8217;s see what it might look like when two developers start to work together with a shared repository.
The first developer, John, clones the repository, makes a change, and commits locally.
(The protocol messages have been replaced with <code>...</code> in these examples to shorten them somewhat.)</p>

This is especially important to understand if you&#8217;re used to Subversion, because you&#8217;ll notice that the two developers didn&#8217;t edit the same file.
Although Subversion automatically does such a merge on the server if different files are edited, in Git you must merge the commits locally.

<p>The <code>issue54..origin/master</code> syntax is a log filter that asks Git to only show the list of commits that are on the latter branch (in this case <code>origin/master</code>) that are not on the first branch (in this case <code>issue54</code>).

<p>Now, Jessica can merge her topic work into her master branch, merge John&#8217;s work (<code>origin/master</code>) into her <code>master</code> branch, and then push back to the server again.

<p>That is one of the simplest workflows.
You work for a while, generally in a topic branch, and merge into your <code>master</code> branch when it&#8217;s ready to be integrated.
When you want to share that work, you fetch and merge your <code>master</code> from <code>origin/master</code> if it has changed, and finally push to the <code>master</code> branch on the server.
The general sequence is something like this:</p>

In this next scenario, you&#8217;ll look at contributor roles in a larger private group.
You&#8217;ll learn how to work in an environment where small groups collaborate on features and then those team-based contributions are integrated by another party.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s say that John and Jessica are working together on one feature, while Jessica and Josie are working on a second.
In this case, the company is using a type of integration-manager workflow where the work of the individual groups is integrated only by certain engineers, and the <code>master</code> branch of the main repo can be updated only by those engineers.
In this scenario, all work is done in team-based branches and pulled together by the integrators later.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s follow Jessica&#8217;s workflow as she works on her two features, collaborating in parallel with two different developers in this environment.
Assuming she already has her repository cloned, she decides to work on <code>featureA</code> first.
She creates a new branch for the feature and does some work on it there:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

 1 files changed, 1 insertions(+), 1 deletions(-)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, she needs to share her work with John, so she pushes her <code>featureA</code> branch commits up to the server.
Jessica doesn&#8217;t have push access to the <code>master</code> branch – only the integrators do – so she has to push to another branch in order to collaborate with John:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Jessica emails John to tell him that she&#8217;s pushed some work into a branch named <code>featureA</code> and he can look at it now.
While she waits for feedback from John, Jessica decides to start working on <code>featureB</code> with Josie.
To begin, she starts a new feature branch, basing it off the server&#8217;s <code>master</code> branch:</p>

<h4 id="_public_project">Forked Public Project</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Contributing to public projects is a bit different.
Because you don&#8217;t have the permissions to directly update branches on the project, you have to get the work to the maintainers some other way.
This first example describes contributing via forking on Git hosts that support easy forking.
Many hosting sites support this (including GitHub, BitBucket, repo.or.cz, and others), and many project maintainers expect this style of contribution.
The next section deals with projects that prefer to accept contributed patches via email.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, you&#8217;ll probably want to clone the main repository, create a topic branch for the patch or patch series you&#8217;re planning to contribute, and do your work there.
The sequence looks basically like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone (url)
$ cd project
$ git checkout -b featureA
# (work)
$ git commit
# (work)
$ git commit</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may want to use <code>rebase -i</code> to squash your work down to a single commit, or rearrange the work in the commits to make the patch easier for the maintainer to review – see <a href="#_rewriting_history">Rewriting History</a> for more information about interactive rebasing.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When your branch work is finished and you&#8217;re ready to contribute it back to the maintainers, go to the original project page and click the &#8220;Fork&#8221; button, creating your own writable fork of the project.
You then need to add in this new repository URL as a second remote, in this case named <code>myfork</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git remote add myfork (url)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then you need to push your work up to it.
It&#8217;s easiest to push the topic branch you&#8217;re working on up to your repository, rather than merging into your master branch and pushing that up.
The reason is that if the work isn&#8217;t accepted or is cherry-picked, you don&#8217;t have to rewind your master branch. (<code>cherry-pick</code> is covered in more detail in <a href="#_rebase_cherry_pick">Rebasing and Cherry-Picking Workflows</a>).
If the maintainers <code>merge</code>, <code>rebase</code>, or <code>cherry-pick</code> your work, you&#8217;ll eventually get it back via pulling from their repository anyhow:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git push -u myfork featureA</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
When your work has been pushed up to your fork, you need to notify the maintainer.
This is often called a pull request, and you can either generate it via the website – GitHub has its own Pull Request mechanism that we&#8217;ll go over in <a href="#_github">GitHub</a> – or you can run the <code>git request-pull</code> command and email the output to the project maintainer manually.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>request-pull</code> command takes the base branch into which you want your topic branch pulled and the Git repository URL you want them to pull from, and outputs a summary of all the changes you&#8217;re asking to be pulled in.
For instance, if Jessica wants to send John a pull request, and she&#8217;s done two commits on the topic branch she just pushed up, she can run this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git request-pull origin/master myfork

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The output can be sent to the maintainer – it tells them where the work was branched from, summarizes the commits, and tells where to pull this work from.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On a project for which you&#8217;re not the maintainer, it&#8217;s generally easier to have a branch like <code>master</code> always track <code>origin/master</code> and to do your work in topic branches that you can easily discard if they&#8217;re rejected.
Having work themes isolated into topic branches also makes it easier for you to rebase your work if the tip of the main repository has moved in the meantime and your commits no longer apply cleanly.
For example, if you want to submit a second topic of work to the project, don&#8217;t continue working on the topic branch you just pushed up – start over from the main repository&#8217;s <code>master</code> branch:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout -b featureB origin/master
# (work)
$ git commit
$ git push myfork featureB
$ git request-pull origin/master myfork
# (email maintainer)
$ git fetch origin</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, each of your topics is contained within a silo – similar to a patch queue – that you can rewrite, rebase, and modify without the topics interfering or interdepending on each other, like so:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/public-small-1.png" alt="Initial commit history with `featureB` work.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 70. Initial commit history with <code>featureB</code> work.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s say the project maintainer has pulled in a bunch of other patches and tried your first branch, but it no longer cleanly merges.
In this case, you can try to rebase that branch on top of <code>origin/master</code>, resolve the conflicts for the maintainer, and then resubmit your changes:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout featureA
$ git rebase origin/master
$ git push -f myfork featureA</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This rewrites your history to now look like <a href="#psp_b">Commit history after <code>featureA</code> work.</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="psp_b" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/public-small-2.png" alt="Commit history after `featureA` work.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 71. Commit history after <code>featureA</code> work.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because you rebased the branch, you have to specify the <code>-f</code> to your push command in order to be able to replace the <code>featureA</code> branch on the server with a commit that isn&#8217;t a descendant of it.
An alternative would be to push this new work to a different branch on the server (perhaps called <code>featureAv2</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s look at one more possible scenario: the maintainer has looked at work in your second branch and likes the concept but would like you to change an implementation detail.
You&#8217;ll also take this opportunity to move the work to be based off the project&#8217;s current <code>master</code> branch.
You start a new branch based off the current <code>origin/master</code> branch, squash the <code>featureB</code> changes there, resolve any conflicts, make the implementation change, and then push that up as a new branch:</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout -b featureBv2 origin/master
$ git merge --squash featureB
# (change implementation)
$ git commit
$ git push myfork featureBv2</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>--squash</code> option takes all the work on the merged branch and squashes it into one changeset producing the repository state as if a real merge happened, without actually making a merge commit.
This means your future commit will have one parent only and allows you to introduce all the changes from another branch and then make more changes before recording the new commit.
Also the <code>--no-commit</code> option can be useful to delay the merge commit in case of the default merge process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you can send the maintainer a message that you&#8217;ve made the requested changes and they can find those changes in your <code>featureBv2</code> branch.</p>

<p>
Many projects have established procedures for accepting patches – you&#8217;ll need to check the specific rules for each project, because they will differ.
Since there are several older, larger projects which accept patches via a developer mailing list, we&#8217;ll go over an example of that now.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The workflow is similar to the previous use case – you create topic branches for each patch series you work on.
The difference is how you submit them to the project.
Instead of forking the project and pushing to your own writable version, you generate email versions of each commit series and email them to the developer mailing list:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout -b topicA
# (work)
$ git commit
# (work)
$ git commit</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Now you have two commits that you want to send to the mailing list.
You use <code>git format-patch</code> to generate the mbox-formatted files that you can email to the list – it turns each commit into an email message with the first line of the commit message as the subject and the rest of the message plus the patch that the commit introduces as the body.
The nice thing about this is that applying a patch from an email generated with <code>format-patch</code> preserves all the commit information properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git format-patch -M origin/master
0001-add-limit-to-log-function.patch
0002-changed-log-output-to-30-from-25.patch</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>format-patch</code> command prints out the names of the patch files it creates.
The <code>-M</code> switch tells Git to look for renames.
The files end up looking like this:</p>

<p>You can also edit these patch files to add more information for the email list that you don&#8217;t want to show up in the commit message.
If you add text between the <code>---</code> line and the beginning of the patch (the <code>diff --git</code> line), then developers can read it; but applying the patch excludes it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To email this to a mailing list, you can either paste the file into your email program or send it via a command-line program.
Pasting the text often causes formatting issues, especially with &#8220;smarter&#8221; clients that don&#8217;t preserve newlines and other whitespace appropriately.
Luckily, Git provides a tool to help you send properly formatted patches via IMAP, which may be easier for you.
We&#8217;ll demonstrate how to send a patch via Gmail, which happens to be the email agent we know best; you can read detailed instructions for a number of mail programs at the end of the aforementioned <code>Documentation/SubmittingPatches</code> file in the Git source code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
First, you need to set up the imap section in your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file.
You can set each value separately with a series of <code>git config</code> commands, or you can add them manually, but in the end your config file should look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[imap]
  folder = "[Gmail]/Drafts"
  host = imaps://imap.gmail.com
  user = user@gmail.com
  pass = p4ssw0rd
  port = 993
  sslverify = false</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your IMAP server doesn&#8217;t use SSL, the last two lines probably aren&#8217;t necessary, and the host value will be <code>imap://</code> instead of <code>imaps://</code>.
When that is set up, you can use <code>git imap-send</code> to place the patch series in the Drafts folder of the specified IMAP server:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat *.patch |git imap-send
Resolving imap.gmail.com... ok
Connecting to [74.125.142.109]:993... ok
Logging in...
sending 2 messages
100% (2/2) done</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, you should be able to go to your Drafts folder, change the To field to the mailing list you&#8217;re sending the patch to, possibly CC the maintainer or person responsible for that section, and send it off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also send the patches through an SMTP server.
As before, you can set each value separately with a series of <code>git config</code> commands, or you can add them manually in the sendemail section in your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[sendemail]
  smtpencryption = tls
  smtpserver = smtp.gmail.com
  smtpuser = user@gmail.com
  smtpserverport = 587</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After this is done, you can use <code>git send-email</code> to send your patches:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git send-email *.patch

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, Git spits out a bunch of log information looking something like this for each patch you&#8217;re sending:</p>

<h4 id="_summary_5">Summary</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section has covered a number of common workflows for dealing with several very different types of Git projects you&#8217;re likely to encounter, and introduced a couple of new tools to help you manage this process.
Next, you&#8217;ll see how to work the other side of the coin: maintaining a Git project.
You&#8217;ll learn how to be a benevolent dictator or integration manager.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_maintaining_a_project">Maintaining a Project</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
In addition to knowing how to effectively contribute to a project, you&#8217;ll likely need to know how to maintain one.
This can consist of accepting and applying patches generated via <code>format-patch</code> and emailed to you, or integrating changes in remote branches for repositories you&#8217;ve added as remotes to your project.
Whether you maintain a canonical repository or want to help by verifying or approving patches, you need to know how to accept work in a way that is clearest for other contributors and sustainable by you over the long run.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_working_in_topic_branches">Working in Topic Branches</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
When you&#8217;re thinking of integrating new work, it&#8217;s generally a good idea to try it out in a topic branch – a temporary branch specifically made to try out that new work.
This way, it&#8217;s easy to tweak a patch individually and leave it if it&#8217;s not working until you have time to come back to it.
If you create a simple branch name based on the theme of the work you&#8217;re going to try, such as <code>ruby_client</code> or something similarly descriptive, you can easily remember it if you have to abandon it for a while and come back later.
The maintainer of the Git project tends to namespace these branches as well – such as <code>sc/ruby_client</code>, where <code>sc</code> is short for the person who contributed the work.
As you&#8217;ll remember, you can create the branch based off your <code>master</code> branch like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch sc/ruby_client master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or, if you want to also switch to it immediately, you can use the <code>checkout -b</code> option:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout -b sc/ruby_client master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you&#8217;re ready to add the contributed work that you received into this topic branch and determine if you want to merge it into your longer-term branches.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_patches_from_email">Applying Patches from Email</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If you receive a patch over email that you need to integrate into your project, you need to apply the patch in your topic branch to evaluate it.
There are two ways to apply an emailed patch: with <code>git apply</code> or with <code>git am</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_applying_a_patch_with_apply">Applying a Patch with apply</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If you received the patch from someone who generated it with the <code>git diff</code> or a Unix <code>diff</code> command (which is not recommended; see the next section), you can apply it with the <code>git apply</code> command.
Assuming you saved the patch at <code>/tmp/patch-ruby-client.patch</code>, you can apply the patch like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git apply /tmp/patch-ruby-client.patch</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This modifies the files in your working directory.
It&#8217;s almost identical to running a <code>patch -p1</code> command to apply the patch, although it&#8217;s more paranoid and accepts fewer fuzzy matches than patch.
It also handles file adds, deletes, and renames if they&#8217;re described in the <code>git diff</code> format, which <code>patch</code> won&#8217;t do.
Finally, <code>git apply</code> is an &#8220;apply all or abort all&#8221; model where either everything is applied or nothing is, whereas <code>patch</code> can partially apply patchfiles, leaving your working directory in a weird state.
<code>git apply</code> is overall much more conservative than <code>patch</code>.
It won&#8217;t create a commit for you – after running it, you must stage and commit the changes introduced manually.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also use <code>git apply</code> to see if a patch applies cleanly before you try actually applying it – you can run <code>git apply --check</code> with the patch:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git apply --check 0001-seeing-if-this-helps-the-gem.patch
error: patch failed: ticgit.gemspec:1
error: ticgit.gemspec: patch does not apply</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there is no output, then the patch should apply cleanly.
This command also exits with a non-zero status if the check fails, so you can use it in scripts if you want.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_git_am">Applying a Patch with <code>am</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If the contributor is a Git user and was good enough to use the <code>format-patch</code> command to generate their patch, then your job is easier because the patch contains author information and a commit message for you.
If you can, encourage your contributors to use <code>format-patch</code> instead of <code>diff</code> to generate patches for you.
You should only have to use <code>git apply</code> for legacy patches and things like that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To apply a patch generated by <code>format-patch</code>, you use <code>git am</code> (the command is named <code>am</code> as it is used to "apply a series of patches from a mailbox").
Technically, <code>git am</code> is built to read an mbox file, which is a simple, plain-text format for storing one or more email messages in one text file.
It looks something like this:</p>

Subject: [PATCH 1/2] add limit to log function

Limit log functionality to the first 20</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the beginning of the output of the <code>format-patch</code> command that you saw in the previous section.
This is also a valid mbox email format.
If someone has emailed you the patch properly using <code>git send-email</code>, and you download that into an mbox format, then you can point <code>git am</code> to that mbox file, and it will start applying all the patches it sees.
If you run a mail client that can save several emails out in mbox format, you can save entire patch series into a file and then use <code>git am</code> to apply them one at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if someone uploaded a patch file generated via <code>format-patch</code> to a ticketing system or something similar, you can save the file locally and then pass that file saved on your disk to <code>git am</code> to apply it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

Applying: add limit to log function</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see that it applied cleanly and automatically created the new commit for you.
The author information is taken from the email&#8217;s <code>From</code> and <code>Date</code> headers, and the message of the commit is taken from the <code>Subject</code> and body (before the patch) of the email.
For example, if this patch was applied from the mbox example above, the commit generated would look something like this:</p>

   add limit to log function

   Limit log functionality to the first 20</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>Commit</code> information indicates the person who applied the patch and the time it was applied.
The <code>Author</code> information is the individual who originally created the patch and when it was originally created.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But it&#8217;s possible that the patch won&#8217;t apply cleanly.
Perhaps your main branch has diverged too far from the branch the patch was built from, or the patch depends on another patch you haven&#8217;t applied yet.
In that case, the <code>git am</code> process will fail and ask you what you want to do:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git am 0001-seeing-if-this-helps-the-gem.patch

error: ticgit.gemspec: patch does not apply
Patch failed at 0001.
When you have resolved this problem run "git am --resolved".
If you would prefer to skip this patch, instead run "git am --skip".
To restore the original branch and stop patching run "git am --abort".</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command puts conflict markers in any files it has issues with, much like a conflicted merge or rebase operation.
You solve this issue much the same way – edit the file to resolve the conflict, stage the new file, and then run <code>git am --resolved</code> to continue to the next patch:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ (fix the file)
$ git add ticgit.gemspec
$ git am --resolved
Applying: seeing if this helps the gem</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want Git to try a bit more intelligently to resolve the conflict, you can pass a <code>-3</code> option to it, which makes Git attempt a three-way merge.
This option isn&#8217;t on by default because it doesn&#8217;t work if the commit the patch says it was based on isn&#8217;t in your repository.
If you do have that commit – if the patch was based on a public commit – then the <code>-3</code> option is generally much smarter about applying a conflicting patch:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git am -3 0001-seeing-if-this-helps-the-gem.patch
Applying: seeing if this helps the gem
error: patch failed: ticgit.gemspec:1

Using index info to reconstruct a base tree...
Falling back to patching base and 3-way merge...
No changes -- Patch already applied.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, without the <code>-3</code> option the patch would have been considered as a conflict.
Since the <code>-3</code> option was used the patch applied cleanly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re applying a number of patches from an mbox, you can also run the <code>am</code> command in interactive mode, which stops at each patch it finds and asks if you want to apply it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is nice if you have a number of patches saved, because you can view the patch first if you don&#8217;t remember what it is, or not apply the patch if you&#8217;ve already done so.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When all the patches for your topic are applied and committed into your branch, you can choose whether and how to integrate them into a longer-running branch.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_checking_out_remotes">Checking Out Remote Branches</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If your contribution came from a Git user who set up their own repository, pushed a number of changes into it, and then sent you the URL to the repository and the name of the remote branch the changes are in, you can add them as a remote and do merges locally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For instance, if Jessica sends you an email saying that she has a great new feature in the <code>ruby-client</code> branch of her repository, you can test it by adding the remote and checking out that branch locally:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git remote add jessica git://github.com/jessica/myproject.git
$ git fetch jessica
$ git checkout -b rubyclient jessica/ruby-client</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If she emails you again later with another branch containing another great feature, you could directly <code>fetch</code> and <code>checkout</code> because you already have the remote setup.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is most useful if you&#8217;re working with a person consistently.
If someone only has a single patch to contribute once in a while, then accepting it over email may be less time consuming than requiring everyone to run their own server and having to continually add and remove remotes to get a few patches.
You&#8217;re also unlikely to want to have hundreds of remotes, each for someone who contributes only a patch or two.
However, scripts and hosted services may make this easier – it depends largely on how you develop and how your contributors develop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other advantage of this approach is that you get the history of the commits as well.
Although you may have legitimate merge issues, you know where in your history their work is based; a proper three-way merge is the default rather than having to supply a <code>-3</code> and hope the patch was generated off a public commit to which you have access.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you aren&#8217;t working with a person consistently but still want to pull from them in this way, you can provide the URL of the remote repository to the <code>git pull</code> command.
This does a one-time pull and doesn&#8217;t save the URL as a remote reference:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git pull https://github.com/onetimeguy/project
From https://github.com/onetimeguy/project
 * branch            HEAD       -&gt; FETCH_HEAD

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_what_is_introduced">Determining What Is Introduced</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Now you have a topic branch that contains contributed work.
At this point, you can determine what you&#8217;d like to do with it.
This section revisits a couple of commands so you can see how you can use them to review exactly what you&#8217;ll be introducing if you merge this into your main branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s often helpful to get a review of all the commits that are in this branch but that aren&#8217;t in your master branch.
You can exclude commits in the master branch by adding the <code>--not</code> option before the branch name.
This does the same thing as the <code>master..contrib</code> format that we used earlier.
For example, if your contributor sends you two patches and you create a branch called <code>contrib</code> and applied those patches there, you can run this:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>To see what changes each commit introduces, remember that you can pass the <code>-p</code> option to <code>git log</code> and it will append the diff introduced to each commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To see a full diff of what would happen if you were to merge this topic branch with another branch, you may have to use a weird trick to get the correct results.
You may think to run this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git diff master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command gives you a diff, but it may be misleading.
If your <code>master</code> branch has moved forward since you created the topic branch from it, then you&#8217;ll get seemingly strange results.
This happens because Git directly compares the snapshots of the last commit of the topic branch you&#8217;re on and the snapshot of the last commit on the <code>master</code> branch.
For example, if you&#8217;ve added a line in a file on the <code>master</code> branch, a direct comparison of the snapshots will look like the topic branch is going to remove that line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If <code>master</code> is a direct ancestor of your topic branch, this isn&#8217;t a problem; but if the two histories have diverged, the diff will look like you&#8217;re adding all the new stuff in your topic branch and removing everything unique to the <code>master</code> branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What you really want to see are the changes added to the topic branch – the work you&#8217;ll introduce if you merge this branch with master.
You do that by having Git compare the last commit on your topic branch with the first common ancestor it has with the master branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Technically, you can do that by explicitly figuring out the common ancestor and then running your diff on it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git merge-base contrib master
36c7dba2c95e6bbb78dfa822519ecfec6e1ca649
$ git diff 36c7db</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, that isn&#8217;t convenient, so Git provides another shorthand for doing the same thing: the triple-dot syntax.
In the context of the <code>diff</code> command, you can put three periods after another branch to do a <code>diff</code> between the last commit of the branch you&#8217;re on and its common ancestor with another branch:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git diff master...contrib</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command shows you only the work your current topic branch has introduced since its common ancestor with master.
That is a very useful syntax to remember.</p>

<h4 id="_integrating_contributed_work">Integrating Contributed Work</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
When all the work in your topic branch is ready to be integrated into a more mainline branch, the question is how to do it.
Furthermore, what overall workflow do you want to use to maintain your project?
You have a number of choices, so we&#8217;ll cover a few of them.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_merging_workflows">Merging Workflows</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
One simple workflow is to merge the work into your <code>master</code> branch.
In this scenario, you have a <code>master</code> branch that contains basically stable code.
When you have work in a topic branch that you&#8217;ve done or that someone has contributed and you&#8217;ve verified, you merge it into your master branch, delete the topic branch, and then continue the process.
If we have a repository with work in two branches named <code>ruby_client</code> and <code>php_client</code> that looks like <a href="#merwf_a">History with several topic branches.</a> and merge <code>ruby_client</code> first and then <code>php_client</code> next, then your history will end up looking like <a href="#merwf_b">After a topic branch merge.</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 74. After a topic branch merge.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is probably the simplest workflow, but it can possibly be problematic if you&#8217;re dealing with larger or more stable projects where you want to be really careful about what you introduce.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have a more important project, you might want to use a two-phase merge cycle.
In this scenario, you have two long-running branches, <code>master</code> and <code>develop</code>, in which you determine that <code>master</code> is updated only when a very stable release is cut and all new code is integrated into the <code>develop</code> branch.
You regularly push both of these branches to the public repository.
Each time you have a new topic branch to merge in (<a href="#merwf_c">Before a topic branch merge.</a>), you merge it into <code>develop</code> (<a href="#merwf_d">After a topic branch merge.</a>); then, when you tag a release, you fast-forward <code>master</code> to wherever the now-stable <code>develop</code> branch is (<a href="#merwf_e">After a project release.</a>).</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This way, when people clone your project&#8217;s repository, they can either check out <code>master</code> to build the latest stable version and keep up to date on that easily, or they can check out <code>develop</code>, which is the more cutting-edge stuff.
You can also extend this concept by having an <code>integrate</code> branch where all the work is merged together.
Then, when the codebase on that branch is stable and passes tests, you merge it into a <code>develop</code> branch; and when that has proven itself stable for a while, you fast-forward your <code>master</code> branch.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_large_merging_workflows">Large-Merging Workflows</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
The Git project has four long-running branches: <code>master</code>, <code>next</code>, and <code>pu</code> (proposed updates) for new work, and <code>maint</code> for maintenance backports.
When new work is introduced by contributors, it&#8217;s collected into topic branches in the maintainer&#8217;s repository in a manner similar to what we&#8217;ve described (see <a href="#merwf_f">Managing a complex series of parallel contributed topic branches.</a>).
At this point, the topics are evaluated to determine whether they&#8217;re safe and ready for consumption or whether they need more work.
If they&#8217;re safe, they&#8217;re merged into <code>next</code>, and that branch is pushed up so everyone can try the topics integrated together.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 78. Managing a complex series of parallel contributed topic branches.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the topics still need work, they&#8217;re merged into <code>pu</code> instead.
When it&#8217;s determined that they&#8217;re totally stable, the topics are re-merged into <code>master</code>.
The <code>next</code> and <code>pu</code> branches are then rebuilt from the <code>master</code>.
This means <code>master</code> almost always moves forward, <code>next</code> is rebased occasionally, and <code>pu</code> is rebased even more often:</p>

<div class="title">Figure 79. Merging contributed topic branches into long-term integration branches.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When a topic branch has finally been merged into <code>master</code>, it&#8217;s removed from the repository.
The Git project also has a <code>maint</code> branch that is forked off from the last release to provide backported patches in case a maintenance release is required.
Thus, when you clone the Git repository, you have four branches that you can check out to evaluate the project in different stages of development, depending on how cutting edge you want to be or how you want to contribute; and the maintainer has a structured workflow to help them vet new contributions.
The Git project&#8217;s workflow is specialized. To clearly understand this you could check out the <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/Documentation/howto/maintain-git.txt">Git Maintainer&#8217;s guide</a>.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_rebase_cherry_pick">Rebasing and Cherry-Picking Workflows</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Other maintainers prefer to rebase or cherry-pick contributed work on top of their master branch, rather than merging it in, to keep a mostly linear history.
When you have work in a topic branch and have determined that you want to integrate it, you move to that branch and run the rebase command to rebuild the changes on top of your current master (or <code>develop</code>, and so on) branch.
If that works well, you can fast-forward your <code>master</code> branch, and you&#8217;ll end up with a linear project history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
The other way to move introduced work from one branch to another is to cherry-pick it.
A cherry-pick in Git is like a rebase for a single commit.
It takes the patch that was introduced in a commit and tries to reapply it on the branch you&#8217;re currently on.
This is useful if you have a number of commits on a topic branch and you want to integrate only one of them, or if you only have one commit on a topic branch and you&#8217;d prefer to cherry-pick it rather than run rebase.
For example, suppose you have a project that looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rebasing-1.png" alt="Example history before a cherry-pick.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 80. Example history before a cherry-pick.</div>

<p>If you want to pull commit <code>e43a6</code> into your master branch, you can run</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git cherry-pick e43a6

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This pulls the same change introduced in <code>e43a6</code>, but you get a new commit SHA-1 value, because the date applied is different.
Now your history looks like this:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you can remove your topic branch and drop the commits you didn&#8217;t want to pull in.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_rerere">Rerere</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If you&#8217;re doing lots of merging and rebasing, or you&#8217;re maintaining a long-lived topic branch, Git has a feature called &#8220;rerere&#8221; that can help.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rerere stands for &#8220;reuse recorded resolution&#8221; – it&#8217;s a way of shortcutting manual conflict resolution.
When rerere is enabled, Git will keep a set of pre- and post-images from successful merges, and if it notices that there&#8217;s a conflict that looks exactly like one you&#8217;ve already fixed, it&#8217;ll just use the fix from last time, without bothering you with it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This feature comes in two parts: a configuration setting and a command.
The configuration setting is <code>rerere.enabled</code>, and it&#8217;s handy enough to put in your global config:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global rerere.enabled true</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, whenever you do a merge that resolves conflicts, the resolution will be recorded in the cache in case you need it in the future.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you need to, you can interact with the rerere cache using the <code>git rerere</code> command.
When it&#8217;s invoked alone, Git checks its database of resolutions and tries to find a match with any current merge conflicts and resolve them (although this is done automatically if <code>rerere.enabled</code> is set to <code>true</code>).
There are also subcommands to see what will be recorded, to erase specific resolution from the cache, and to clear the entire cache.
We will cover rerere in more detail in <a href="#_rerere">Rerere</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_tagging_releases">Tagging Your Releases</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
When you&#8217;ve decided to cut a release, you&#8217;ll probably want to drop a tag so you can re-create that release at any point going forward.
You can create a new tag as discussed in <a href="#_git_basics_chapter">Git Basics</a>.
If you decide to sign the tag as the maintainer, the tagging may look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git tag -s v1.5 -m 'my signed 1.5 tag'
You need a passphrase to unlock the secret key for
user: "Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt;"
1024-bit DSA key, ID F721C45A, created 2009-02-09</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you do sign your tags, you may have the problem of distributing the public PGP key used to sign your tags.
The maintainer of the Git project has solved this issue by including their public key as a blob in the repository and then adding a tag that points directly to that content.
To do this, you can figure out which key you want by running <code>gpg --list-keys</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ gpg --list-keys
/Users/schacon/.gnupg/pubring.gpg
---------------------------------
pub   1024D/F721C45A 2009-02-09 [expires: 2010-02-09]
uid                  Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@gmail.com&gt;
sub   2048g/45D02282 2009-02-09 [expires: 2010-02-09]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, you can directly import the key into the Git database by exporting it and piping that through <code>git hash-object</code>, which writes a new blob with those contents into Git and gives you back the SHA-1 of the blob:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ gpg -a --export F721C45A | git hash-object -w --stdin
659ef797d181633c87ec71ac3f9ba29fe5775b92</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you have the contents of your key in Git, you can create a tag that points directly to it by specifying the new SHA-1 value that the <code>hash-object</code> command gave you:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git tag -a maintainer-pgp-pub 659ef797d181633c87ec71ac3f9ba29fe5775b92</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you run <code>git push --tags</code>, the <code>maintainer-pgp-pub</code> tag will be shared with everyone.
If anyone wants to verify a tag, they can directly import your PGP key by pulling the blob directly out of the database and importing it into GPG:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git show maintainer-pgp-pub | gpg --import</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They can use that key to verify all your signed tags.
Also, if you include instructions in the tag message, running <code>git show &lt;tag&gt;</code> will let you give the end user more specific instructions about tag verification.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_build_number">Generating a Build Number</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Because Git doesn&#8217;t have monotonically increasing numbers like <em>v123</em> or the equivalent to go with each commit, if you want to have a human-readable name to go with a commit, you can run <code>git describe</code> on that commit.
Git gives you the name of the nearest tag with the number of commits on top of that tag and a partial SHA-1 value of the commit you&#8217;re describing:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git describe master
v1.6.2-rc1-20-g8c5b85c</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This way, you can export a snapshot or build and name it something understandable to people.
In fact, if you build Git from source code cloned from the Git repository, <code>git --version</code> gives you something that looks like this.
If you&#8217;re describing a commit that you have directly tagged, it gives you the tag name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git describe</code> command favors annotated tags (tags created with the <code>-a</code> or <code>-s</code> flag), so release tags should be created this way if you&#8217;re using <code>git describe</code>, to ensure the commit is named properly when described.
You can also use this string as the target of a checkout or show command, although it relies on the abbreviated SHA-1 value at the end, so it may not be valid forever.
For instance, the Linux kernel recently jumped from 8 to 10 characters to ensure SHA-1 object uniqueness, so older <code>git describe</code> output names were invalidated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_preparing_release">Preparing a Release</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Now you want to release a build.
One of the things you&#8217;ll want to do is create an archive of the latest snapshot of your code for those poor souls who don&#8217;t use Git.
The command to do this is <code>git archive</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git archive master --prefix='project/' | gzip &gt; `git describe master`.tar.gz
$ ls *.tar.gz
v1.6.2-rc1-20-g8c5b85c.tar.gz</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If someone opens that tarball, they get the latest snapshot of your project under a project directory.
You can also create a zip archive in much the same way, but by passing the <code>--format=zip</code> option to <code>git archive</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git archive master --prefix='project/' --format=zip &gt; `git describe master`.zip</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You now have a nice tarball and a zip archive of your project release that you can upload to your website or email to people.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="_the_shortlog">The Shortlog</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
It&#8217;s time to email your mailing list of people who want to know what&#8217;s happening in your project.
A nice way of quickly getting a sort of changelog of what has been added to your project since your last release or email is to use the <code>git shortlog</code> command.
It summarizes all the commits in the range you give it; for example, the following gives you a summary of all the commits since your last release, if your last release was named v1.0.1:</p>

GitHub is the single largest host for Git repositories, and is the central point of collaboration for millions of developers and projects.
A large percentage of all Git repositories are hosted on GitHub, and many open-source projects use it for Git hosting, issue tracking, code review, and other things.
So while it&#8217;s not a direct part of the Git open source project, there&#8217;s a good chance that you&#8217;ll want or need to interact with GitHub at some point while using Git professionally.</p>

The top address is verified and set as the primary address, meaning that is where you&#8217;ll get any notifications and receipts.
The second address is verified and so can be set as the primary if you wish to switch them.
The final address is unverified, meaning that you can&#8217;t make it your primary address.
If GitHub sees any of these in commit messages in any repository on the site, it will be linked to your user now.</p>

<p>Finally, for extra security, you should definitely set up Two-factor Authentication or &#8220;2FA&#8221;.
Two-factor Authentication is an authentication mechanism that is becoming more and more popular recently to mitigate the risk of your account being compromised if your password is stolen somehow.
Turning it on will make GitHub ask you for two different methods of authentication, so that if one of them is compromised, an attacker will not be able to access your account.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can find the Two-factor Authentication setup under the Security tab of your Account settings.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_forking_projects">Forking Projects</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If you want to contribute to an existing project to which you don’t have push access, you can &#8220;fork&#8221; the project.
When you &#8220;fork&#8221; a project, GitHub will make a copy of the project that is entirely yours; it lives in your namespace, and you can push to it.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Historically, the term &#8220;fork&#8221; has been somewhat negative in context, meaning that someone took an open source project in a different direction, sometimes creating a competing project and splitting the contributors.
In GitHub, a &#8220;fork&#8221; is simply the same project in your own namespace, allowing you to make changes to a project publicly as a way to contribute in a more open manner.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This way, projects don’t have to worry about adding users as collaborators to give them push access.
People can fork a project, push to it, and contribute their changes back to the original repository by creating what&#8217;s called a Pull Request, which we&#8217;ll cover next.
This opens up a discussion thread with code review, and the owner and the contributor can then communicate about the change until the owner is happy with it, at which point the owner can merge it in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To fork a project, visit the project page and click the &#8220;Fork&#8221; button at the top-right of the page.</p>

<h4 id="_github_flow">The GitHub Flow</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
GitHub is designed around a particular collaboration workflow, centered on Pull Requests.
This flow works whether you&#8217;re collaborating with a tightly-knit team in a single shared repository, or a globally-distributed company or network of strangers contributing to a project through dozens of forks.
It is centered on the <a href="#_topic_branch">Topic Branches</a> workflow covered in <a href="#_git_branching">Git Branching</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s how it generally works:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Fork the project</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Create a topic branch from <code>master</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make some commits to improve the project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Push this branch to your GitHub project.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open a Pull Request on GitHub.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Discuss, and optionally continue committing.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The project owner merges or closes the Pull Request.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is basically the Integration Manager workflow covered in <a href="#_integration_manager">Integration-Manager Workflow</a>, but instead of using email to communicate and review changes, teams use GitHub&#8217;s web based tools.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, we click the <em>Fork</em> button as mentioned earlier to get our own copy of the project.
Our user name here is &#8220;tonychacon&#8221; so our copy of this project is at <code>https://github.com/tonychacon/blink</code> and that&#8217;s where we can edit it.

<p>
If we click that green button, we&#8217;ll see a screen that asks us to give our Pull Request a title and description.
It is almost always worthwhile to put some effort into this, since a good description helps the owner of the original project determine what you were trying to do, whether your proposed changes are correct, and whether accepting the changes would improve the original project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also see a list of the commits in our topic branch that are &#8220;ahead&#8221; of the <code>master</code> branch (in this case, just the one) and a unified diff of all the changes that will be made should this branch get merged by the project owner.</p>

<p>Though Pull Requests are used commonly for public projects like this when the contributor has a complete change ready to be made, it&#8217;s also often used in internal projects <em>at the beginning</em> of the development cycle. Since you can keep pushing to the topic branch even <strong>after</strong> the Pull Request is opened, it&#8217;s often opened early and used as a way to iterate on work as a team within a context, rather than opened at the very end of the process.</p>

<p>At this point, the project owner can look at the suggested change and merge it, reject it or comment on it. Let&#8217;s say that he likes the idea, but would prefer a slightly longer time for the light to be off than on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Where this conversation may take place over email in the workflows presented in <a href="#_distributed_git">Distributed Git</a>, on GitHub this happens online. The project owner can review the unified diff and leave a comment by clicking on any of the lines.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once the maintainer makes this comment, the person who opened the Pull Request (and indeed, anyone else watching the repository) will get a notification. We&#8217;ll go over customizing this later, but if he had email notifications turned on, Tony would get an email like this:</p>

<div class="title">Figure 94. Comments sent as email notifications</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Anyone can also leave general comments on the Pull Request. In <a href="#_pr_discussion">Pull Request discussion page</a> we can see an example of the project owner both commenting on a line of code and then leaving a general comment in the discussion section. You can see that the code comments are brought into the conversation as well.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now the contributor can see what they need to do in order to get their change accepted.
Luckily this is very straightforward.
Where over email you may have to re-roll your series and resubmit it to the mailing list, with GitHub you simply commit to the topic branch again and push, which will automatically update the Pull Request.
In <a href="#_pr_final">Pull Request final</a> you can also see that the old code comment has been collapsed in the updated Pull Request, since it was made on a line that has since been changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Adding commits to an existing Pull Request doesn&#8217;t trigger a notification, so once Tony has pushed his corrections he decides to leave a comment to inform the project owner that he made the requested change.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>An interesting thing to notice is that if you click on the &#8220;Files Changed&#8221; tab on this Pull Request, you&#8217;ll get the &#8220;unified&#8221; diff&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;that is, the total aggregate difference that would be introduced to your main branch if this topic branch was merged in. In <code>git diff</code> terms, it basically automatically shows you <code>git diff master...&lt;branch&gt;</code> for the branch this Pull Request is based on. See <a href="#_what_is_introduced">Determining What Is Introduced</a> for more about this type of diff.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other thing you&#8217;ll notice is that GitHub checks to see if the Pull Request merges cleanly and provides a button to do the merge for you on the server. This button only shows up if you have write access to the repository and a trivial merge is possible. If you click it GitHub will perform a &#8220;non-fast-forward&#8221; merge, meaning that even if the merge <strong>could</strong> be a fast-forward, it will still create a merge commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you would prefer, you can simply pull the branch down and merge it locally. If you merge this branch into the <code>master</code> branch and push it to GitHub, the Pull Request will automatically be closed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the basic workflow that most GitHub projects use. Topic branches are created, Pull Requests are opened on them, a discussion ensues, possibly more work is done on the branch and eventually the request is either closed or merged.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we&#8217;ve covered the basics of contributing to a project on GitHub, let&#8217;s cover a few interesting tips and tricks about Pull Requests so you can be more effective in using them.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_pull_requests_as_patches">Pull Requests as Patches</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important to understand that many projects don&#8217;t really think of Pull Requests as queues of perfect patches that should apply cleanly in order, as most mailing list-based projects think of patch series contributions. Most GitHub projects think about Pull Request branches as iterative conversations around a proposed change, culminating in a unified diff that is applied by merging.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is an important distinction, because generally the change is suggested before the code is thought to be perfect, which is far more rare with mailing list based patch series contributions. This enables an earlier conversation with the maintainers so that arriving at the proper solution is more of a community effort. When code is proposed with a Pull Request and the maintainers or community suggest a change, the patch series is generally not re-rolled, but instead the difference is pushed as a new commit to the branch, moving the conversation forward with the context of the previous work intact.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For instance, if you go back and look again at <a href="#_pr_final">Pull Request final</a>, you&#8217;ll notice that the contributor did not rebase his commit and send another Pull Request. Instead they added new commits and pushed them to the existing branch. This way if you go back and look at this Pull Request in the future, you can easily find all of the context of why decisions were made. Pushing the &#8220;Merge&#8221; button on the site purposefully creates a merge commit that references the Pull Request so that it&#8217;s easy to go back and research the original conversation if necessary.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_keeping_up_with_upstream">Keeping up with Upstream</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your Pull Request becomes out of date or otherwise doesn&#8217;t merge cleanly, you will want to fix it so the maintainer can easily merge it. GitHub will test this for you and let you know at the bottom of every Pull Request if the merge is trivial or not.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 97. Pull Request does not merge cleanly</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you see something like <a href="#_pr_fail">Pull Request does not merge cleanly</a>, you&#8217;ll want to fix your branch so that it turns green and the maintainer doesn&#8217;t have to do extra work.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have two main options in order to do this. You can either rebase your branch on top of whatever the target branch is (normally the <code>master</code> branch of the repository you forked), or you can merge the target branch into your branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most developers on GitHub will choose to do the latter, for the same reasons we just went over in the previous section. What matters is the history and the final merge, so rebasing isn&#8217;t getting you much other than a slightly cleaner history and in return is <strong>far</strong> more difficult and error prone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to merge in the target branch to make your Pull Request mergeable, you would add the original repository as a new remote, fetch from it, merge the main branch of that repository into your topic branch, fix any issues and finally push it back up to the same branch you opened the Pull Request on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say that in the &#8220;tonychacon&#8221; example we were using before, the original author made a change that would create a conflict in the Pull Request. Let&#8217;s go through those steps.</p>

<p>One of the great things about Git is that you can do that continuously. If you have a very long-running project, you can easily merge from the target branch over and over again and only have to deal with conflicts that have arisen since the last time that you merged, making the process very manageable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you absolutely wish to rebase the branch to clean it up, you can certainly do so, but it is highly encouraged to not force push over the branch that the Pull Request is already opened on. If other people have pulled it down and done more work on it, you run into all of the issues outlined in <a href="#_rebase_peril">The Perils of Rebasing</a>. Instead, push the rebased branch to a new branch on GitHub and open a brand new Pull Request referencing the old one, then close the original.</p>

<h5 id="_references">References</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your next question may be &#8220;How do I reference the old Pull Request?&#8221;. It turns out there are many, many ways to reference other things almost anywhere you can write in GitHub.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s start with how to cross-reference another Pull Request or an Issue. All Pull Requests and Issues are assigned numbers and they are unique within the project. For example, you can&#8217;t have Pull Request #3 <em>and</em> Issue #3. If you want to reference any Pull Request or Issue from any other one, you can simply put <code>#&lt;num&gt;</code> in any comment or description. You can also be more specific if the Issue or Pull request lives somewhere else; write <code>username#&lt;num&gt;</code> if you&#8217;re referring to an Issue or Pull Request in a fork of the repository you&#8217;re in, or <code>username/repo#&lt;num&gt;</code> to reference something in another repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s look at an example. Say we rebased the branch in the previous example, created a new pull request for it, and now we want to reference the old pull request from the new one. We also want to reference an issue in the fork of the repository and an issue in a completely different project. We can fill out the description just like <a href="#_pr_references">Cross references in a Pull Request.</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="_pr_references" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/mentions-01-syntax.png" alt="PR references">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 99. Cross references in a Pull Request.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we submit this pull request, we&#8217;ll see all of that rendered like <a href="#_pr_references_render">Cross references rendered in a Pull Request.</a>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that the full GitHub URL we put in there was shortened to just the information needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now if Tony goes back and closes out the original Pull Request, we can see that by mentioning it in the new one, GitHub has automatically created a trackback event in the Pull Request timeline. This means that anyone who visits this Pull Request and sees that it is closed can easily link back to the one that superseded it. The link will look something like <a href="#_pr_closed">Cross references rendered in a Pull Request.</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="_pr_closed" class="imageblock">

<div class="title">Figure 101. Cross references rendered in a Pull Request.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to issue numbers, you can also reference a specific commit by SHA-1. You have to specify a full 40 character SHA-1, but if GitHub sees that in a comment, it will link directly to the commit. Again, you can reference commits in forks or other repositories in the same way you did with issues.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_github_flavored_markdown">GitHub Flavored Markdown</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Linking to other Issues is just the beginning of interesting things you can do with almost any text box on GitHub. In  Issue and Pull Request descriptions, comments, code comments and more, you can use what is called &#8220;GitHub Flavored Markdown&#8221;. Markdown is like writing in plain text but which is rendered richly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>See <a href="#_example_markdown">An example of GitHub Flavored Markdown as written and as rendered.</a> for an example of how comments or text can be written and then rendered using Markdown.</p>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 102. An example of GitHub Flavored Markdown as written and as rendered.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The GitHub flavor of Markdown adds more things you can do beyond the basic Markdown syntax. These can all be really useful when creating useful Pull Request or Issue comments or descriptions.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_task_lists">Task Lists</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first really useful GitHub specific Markdown feature, especially for use in Pull Requests, is the Task List. A task list is a list of checkboxes of things you want to get done. Putting them into an Issue or Pull Request normally indicates things that you want to get done before you consider the item complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can create a task list like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">- [X] Write the code
- [ ] Write all the tests
- [ ] Document the code</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we include this in the description of our Pull Request or Issue, we&#8217;ll see it rendered like <a href="#_task_lists">Task lists rendered in a Markdown comment.</a></p>
</div>
<div id="_task_lists" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/markdown-02-tasks.png" alt="Example Task List">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 103. Task lists rendered in a Markdown comment.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is often used in Pull Requests to indicate what all you would like to get done on the branch before the Pull Request will be ready to merge. The really cool part is that you can simply click the checkboxes to update the comment&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;you don&#8217;t have to edit the Markdown directly to check tasks off.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What&#8217;s more, GitHub will look for task lists in your Issues and Pull Requests and show them as metadata on the pages that list them out. For example, if you have a Pull Request with tasks and you look at the overview page of all Pull Requests, you can see how far done it is. This helps people break down Pull Requests into subtasks and helps other people track the progress of the branch. You can see an example of this in <a href="#_task_list_progress">Task list summary in the Pull Request list.</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="_task_list_progress" class="imageblock">

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 104. Task list summary in the Pull Request list.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These are incredibly useful when you open a Pull Request early and use it to track your progress through the implementation of the feature.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_code_snippets">Code Snippets</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also add code snippets to comments. This is especially useful if you want to present something that you <em>could</em> try to do before actually implementing it as a commit on your branch. This is also often used to add example code of what is not working or what this Pull Request could implement.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To add a snippet of code you have to &#8220;fence&#8221; it in backticks.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">```java
for(int i=0 ; i &lt; 5 ; i++)
{
   System.out.println("i is : " + i);
}
```</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you add a language name like we did there with <em>java</em>, GitHub will also try to syntax highlight the snippet. In the case of the above example, it would end up rendering like <a href="#_md_code">Rendered fenced code example.</a>.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_quoting">Quoting</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re responding to a small part of a long comment, you can selectively quote out of the other comment by preceding the lines with the <code>&gt;</code> character. In fact, this is so common and so useful that there is a keyboard shortcut for it. If you highlight text in a comment that you want to directly reply to and hit the <code>r</code> key, it will quote that text in the comment box for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The quotes look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">&gt; Whether 'tis Nobler in the mind to suffer
&gt; The Slings and Arrows of outrageous Fortune,

How big are these slings and in particular, these arrows?</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<h5 id="_emoji">Emoji</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, you can also use emoji in your comments. This is actually used quite extensively in comments you see on many GitHub Issues and Pull Requests. There is even an emoji helper in GitHub. If you are typing a comment and you start with a <code>:</code> character, an autocompleter will help you find what you&#8217;re looking for.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Emojis take the form of <code>:&lt;name&gt;:</code> anywhere in the comment. For instance, you could write something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">I :eyes: that :bug: and I :cold_sweat:.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This isn&#8217;t technically GitHub Flavored Markdown, but it is incredibly useful. In addition to adding Markdown image links to comments, which can be difficult to find and embed URLs for, GitHub allows you to drag and drop images into text areas to embed them.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s create a new repository to share our project code with.

<p>All you really have to do here is provide a project name; the rest of the fields are completely optional.
For now, just click the &#8220;Create Repository&#8221; button, and boom – you have a new repository on GitHub, named <code>&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project_name&gt;</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since you have no code there yet, GitHub will show you instructions for how to create a brand-new Git repository, or connect an existing Git project.
We won&#8217;t belabor this here; if you need a refresher, check out <a href="#_git_basics_chapter">Git Basics</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that your project is hosted on GitHub, you can give the URL to anyone you want to share your project with.
Every project on GitHub is accessible over HTTPS as <code>https://github.com/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project_name&gt;</code>, and over SSH as <code>git@github.com:&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project_name&gt;</code>.
Git can fetch from and push to both of these URLs, but they are access-controlled based on the credentials of the user connecting to them.</p>

The HTTPS one is also exactly the same URL they would paste into a browser to view the project there.</p>

If Ben, Jeff, and Louise all sign up for accounts on GitHub, and you want to give them push access to your repository, you can add them to your project.
Doing so will give them &#8220;push&#8221; access, which means they have both read and write access to the project and Git repository.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you have a project with some code in it and maybe even a few collaborators who also have push access, let&#8217;s go over what to do when you get a Pull Request yourself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pull Requests can either come from a branch in a fork of your repository or they can come from another branch in the same repository.
The only difference is that the ones in a fork are often from people where you can&#8217;t push to their branch and they can&#8217;t push to yours, whereas with internal Pull Requests generally both parties can access the branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For these examples, let&#8217;s assume you are &#8220;tonychacon&#8221; and you&#8217;ve created a new Arduino code project named &#8220;fade&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_email_notifications">Email Notifications</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Someone comes along and makes a change to your code and sends you a Pull Request.
You should get an email notifying you about the new Pull Request and it should look something like <a href="#_email_pr">Email notification of a new Pull Request.</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="_email_pr" class="imageblock">

<p>There are a few things to notice about this email.
It will give you a small diffstat&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;a list of files that have changed in the Pull Request and by how much.
It gives you a link to the Pull Request on GitHub.
It also gives you a few URLs that you can use from the command line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you notice the line that says <code>git pull &lt;url&gt; patch-1</code>, this is a simple way to merge in a remote branch without having to add a remote.
We went over this quickly in <a href="#_checking_out_remotes">Checking Out Remote Branches</a>.
If you wish, you can create and switch to a topic branch and then run this command to merge in the Pull Request changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other interesting URLs are the <code>.diff</code> and <code>.patch</code> URLs, which as you may guess, provide unified diff and patch versions of the Pull Request.
You could technically merge in the Pull Request work with something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ curl http://github.com/tonychacon/fade/pull/1.patch | git am</code></pre>

<h5 id="_collaborating_on_the_pull_request">Collaborating on the Pull Request</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we covered in <a href="#_github_flow">The GitHub Flow</a>, you can now have a conversation with the person who opened the Pull Request.
You can comment on specific lines of code, comment on whole commits or comment on the entire Pull Request itself, using GitHub Flavored Markdown everywhere.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every time someone else comments on the Pull Request you will continue to get email notifications so you know there is activity happening.
They will each have a link to the Pull Request where the activity is happening and you can also directly respond to the email to comment on the Pull Request thread.</p>

<p>Once the code is in a place you like and want to merge it in, you can either pull the code down and merge it locally, either with the <code>git pull &lt;url&gt; &lt;branch&gt;</code> syntax we saw earlier, or by adding the fork as a remote and fetching and merging.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the merge is trivial, you can also just hit the &#8220;Merge&#8221; button on the GitHub site.
This will do a &#8220;non-fast-forward&#8221; merge, creating a merge commit even if a fast-forward merge was possible.
This means that no matter what, every time you hit the merge button, a merge commit is created.
As you can see in <a href="#_merge_button">Merge button and instructions for merging a Pull Request manually.</a>, GitHub gives you all of this information if you click the hint link.</p>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_pr_refs">Pull Request Refs</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re dealing with a <strong>lot</strong> of Pull Requests and don&#8217;t want to add a bunch of remotes or do one time pulls every time, there is a neat trick that GitHub allows you to do.
This is a bit of an advanced trick and we&#8217;ll go over the details of this a bit more in <a href="#_refspec">The Refspec</a>, but it can be pretty useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GitHub actually advertises the Pull Request branches for a repository as sort of pseudo-branches on the server.
By default you don&#8217;t get them when you clone, but they are there in an obscured way and you can access them pretty easily.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To demonstrate this, we&#8217;re going to use a low-level command (often referred to as a &#8220;plumbing&#8221; command, which we&#8217;ll read about more in <a href="#_plumbing_porcelain">Plumbing and Porcelain</a>) called <code>ls-remote</code>.
This command is generally not used in day-to-day Git operations but it&#8217;s useful to show us what references are present on the server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we run this command against the &#8220;blink&#8221; repository we were using earlier, we will get a list of all the branches and tags and other references in the repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git ls-remote https://github.com/schacon/blink

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Of course, if you&#8217;re in your repository and you run <code>git ls-remote origin</code> or whatever remote you want to check, it will show you something similar to this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the repository is on GitHub and you have any Pull Requests that have been opened, you&#8217;ll get these references that are prefixed with <code>refs/pull/</code>.
These are basically branches, but since they&#8217;re not under <code>refs/heads/</code> you don&#8217;t get them normally when you clone or fetch from the server&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the process of fetching ignores them normally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two references per Pull Request - the one that ends in <code>/head</code> points to exactly the same commit as the last commit in the Pull Request branch.
So if someone opens a Pull Request in our repository and their branch is named <code>bug-fix</code> and it points to commit <code>a5a775</code>, then in <strong>our</strong> repository we will not have a <code>bug-fix</code> branch (since that&#8217;s in their fork), but we <em>will</em> have <code>pull/&lt;pr#&gt;/head</code> that points to <code>a5a775</code>.
This means that we can pretty easily pull down every Pull Request branch in one go without having to add a bunch of remotes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, you could do something like fetching the reference directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git fetch origin refs/pull/958/head

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This tells Git, &#8220;Connect to the <code>origin</code> remote, and download the ref named <code>refs/pull/958/head</code>.&#8221;
Git happily obeys, and downloads everything you need to construct that ref, and puts a pointer to the commit you want under <code>.git/FETCH_HEAD</code>.
You can follow that up with <code>git merge FETCH_HEAD</code> into a branch you want to test it in, but that merge commit message looks a bit weird.
Also, if you&#8217;re reviewing a <strong>lot</strong> of pull requests, this gets tedious.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s also a way to fetch <em>all</em> of the pull requests, and keep them up to date whenever you connect to the remote.
Open up <code>.git/config</code> in your favorite editor, and look for the <code>origin</code> remote.
It should look a bit like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[remote "origin"]
    url = https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That line that begins with <code>fetch =</code> is a &#8220;refspec.&#8221;
It&#8217;s a way of mapping names on the remote with names in your local <code>.git</code> directory.
This particular one tells Git, "the things on the remote that are under <code>refs/heads</code> should go in my local repository under <code>refs/remotes/origin</code>."
You can modify this section to add another refspec:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[remote "origin"]
    url = https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2.git
    fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
    fetch = +refs/pull/*/head:refs/remotes/origin/pr/*</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That last line tells Git, &#8220;All the refs that look like <code>refs/pull/123/head</code> should be stored locally like <code>refs/remotes/origin/pr/123</code>.&#8221;
Now, if you save that file, and do a <code>git fetch</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git fetch
# …
 * [new ref]         refs/pull/1/head -&gt; origin/pr/1
 * [new ref]         refs/pull/2/head -&gt; origin/pr/2
 * [new ref]         refs/pull/4/head -&gt; origin/pr/4
# …</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now all of the remote pull requests are represented locally with refs that act much like tracking branches; they&#8217;re read-only, and they update when you do a fetch.
This makes it super easy to try the code from a pull request locally:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout pr/2
Checking out files: 100% (3769/3769), done.
Branch pr/2 set up to track remote branch pr/2 from origin.
Switched to a new branch 'pr/2'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The eagle-eyed among you would note the <code>head</code> on the end of the remote portion of the refspec.
There&#8217;s also a <code>refs/pull/#/merge</code> ref on the GitHub side, which represents the commit that would result if you push the &#8220;merge&#8221; button on the site.
This can allow you to test the merge before even hitting the button.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_pull_requests_on_pull_requests">Pull Requests on Pull Requests</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not only can you open Pull Requests that target the main or <code>master</code> branch, you can actually open a Pull Request targeting any branch in the network.
In fact, you can even target another Pull Request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you see a Pull Request that is moving in the right direction and you have an idea for a change that depends on it or you&#8217;re not sure is a good idea, or you just don&#8217;t have push access to the target branch, you can open a Pull Request directly to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you go to open a Pull Request, there is a box at the top of the page that specifies which branch you&#8217;re requesting to pull to and which you&#8217;re requesting to pull from.
If you hit the &#8220;Edit&#8221; button at the right of that box you can change not only the branches but also which fork.</p>

<div class="title">Figure 118. Manually change the Pull Request target fork and branch.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here you can fairly easily specify to merge your new branch into another Pull Request or another fork of the project.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_mentions_and_notifications">Mentions and Notifications</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GitHub also has a pretty nice notifications system built in that can come in handy when you have questions or need feedback from specific individuals or teams.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In any comment you can start typing a <code>@</code> character and it will begin to autocomplete with the names and usernames of people who are collaborators or contributors in the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/maint-05-mentions.png" alt="Mentions">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 119. Start typing @ to mention someone.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also mention a user who is not in that dropdown, but often the autocompleter can make it faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you post a comment with a user mention, that user will be notified.
This means that this can be a really effective way of pulling people into conversations rather than making them poll.
Very often in  Pull Requests on GitHub people will pull in other people on their teams or in their company to review an Issue or Pull Request.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If someone gets mentioned on a Pull Request or Issue, they will be &#8220;subscribed&#8221; to it and will continue getting notifications any time some activity occurs on it.
You will also be subscribed to something if you opened it, if you&#8217;re watching the repository or if you comment on something.
If you no longer wish to receive notifications, there is an &#8220;Unsubscribe&#8221; button on the page you can click to stop receiving updates on it.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/maint-06-unsubscribe.png" alt="Unsubscribe">

<div class="title">Figure 120. Unsubscribe from an Issue or Pull Request.</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_the_notifications_page">The Notifications Page</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we mention &#8220;notifications&#8221; here with respect to GitHub, we mean a specific way that GitHub tries to get in touch with you when events happen and there are a few different ways you can configure them.
If you go to the &#8220;Notification center&#8221; tab from the settings page, you can see some of the options you have.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/maint-07-notifications.png" alt="Notification center">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 121. Notification center options.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The two choices are to get notifications over &#8220;Email&#8221; and over &#8220;Web&#8221; and you can choose either, neither or both for when you actively participate in things and for activity on repositories you are watching.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_web_notifications">Web Notifications</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Web notifications only exist on GitHub and you can only check them on GitHub.
If you have this option selected in your preferences and a notification is triggered for you, you will see a small blue dot over your notifications icon at the top of your screen as seen in <a href="#_not_center">Notification center.</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="_not_center" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/maint-08-notifications-page.png" alt="Notification center">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 122. Notification center.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you click on that, you will see a list of all the items you have been notified about, grouped by project.
You can filter to the notifications of a specific project by clicking on its name in the left hand sidebar.
You can also acknowledge the notification by clicking the checkmark icon next to any notification, or acknowledge <em>all</em> of the notifications in a project by clicking the checkmark at the top of the group.
There is also a mute button next to each checkmark that you can click to not receive any further notifications on that item.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All of these tools are very useful for handling large numbers of notifications.
Many GitHub power users will simply turn off email notifications entirely and manage all of their notifications through this screen.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_email_notifications_2">Email Notifications</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Email notifications are the other way you can handle notifications through GitHub.
If you have this turned on you will get emails for each notification.
We saw examples of this in <a href="#_email_notification">Comments sent as email notifications</a> and <a href="#_email_pr">Email notification of a new Pull Request.</a>.
The emails will also be threaded properly, which is nice if you&#8217;re using a threading email client.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is also a fair amount of metadata embedded in the headers of the emails that GitHub sends you, which can be really helpful for setting up custom filters and rules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For instance, if we look at the actual email headers sent to Tony in the email shown in <a href="#_email_pr">Email notification of a new Pull Request.</a>, we will see the following among the information sent:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-mbox" data-lang="mbox">To: tonychacon/fade &lt;fade@noreply.github.com&gt;
Message-ID: &lt;tonychacon/fade/pull/1@github.com&gt;
Subject: [fade] Wait longer to see the dimming effect better (#1)
X-GitHub-Recipient: tonychacon
List-ID: tonychacon/fade &lt;fade.tonychacon.github.com&gt;
List-Archive: https://github.com/tonychacon/fade
List-Post: &lt;mailto:reply+i-4XXX@reply.github.com&gt;
List-Unsubscribe: &lt;mailto:unsub+i-XXX@reply.github.com&gt;,...
X-GitHub-Recipient-Address: tchacon@example.com</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a couple of interesting things here.
If you want to highlight or re-route emails to this particular project or even Pull Request, the information in <code>Message-ID</code> gives you all the data in <code>&lt;user&gt;/&lt;project&gt;/&lt;type&gt;/&lt;id&gt;</code> format.
If this were an issue, for example, the <code>&lt;type&gt;</code> field would have been &#8220;issues&#8221; rather than &#8220;pull&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>List-Post</code> and <code>List-Unsubscribe</code> fields mean that if you have a mail client that understands those, you can easily post to the list or &#8220;Unsubscribe&#8221; from the thread.
That would be essentially the same as clicking the &#8220;mute&#8221; button on the web version of the notification or &#8220;Unsubscribe&#8221; on the Issue or Pull Request page itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s also worth noting that if you have both email and web notifications enabled and you read the email version of the notification, the web version will be marked as read as well if you have images allowed in your mail client.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_special_files">Special Files</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a couple of special files that GitHub will notice if they are present in your repository.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_readme">README</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first is the <code>README</code> file, which can be of nearly any format that GitHub recognizes as prose.
For example, it could be <code>README</code>, <code>README.md</code>, <code>README.asciidoc</code>, etc.
If GitHub sees a README file in your source, it will render it on the landing page of the project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many teams use this file to hold all the relevant project information for someone who might be new to the repository or project.
This generally includes things like:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>What the project is for</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to configure and install it</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>An example of how to use it or get it running</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The license that the project is offered under</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How to contribute to it</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since GitHub will render this file, you can embed images or links in it for added ease of understanding.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_contributing">CONTRIBUTING</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other special file that GitHub recognizes is the <code>CONTRIBUTING</code> file.
If you have a file named <code>CONTRIBUTING</code> with any file extension, GitHub will show <a href="#_contrib_file">Opening a Pull Request when a CONTRIBUTING file exists.</a> when anyone starts opening a Pull Request.</p>
</div>
<div id="_contrib_file" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/maint-09-contrib.png" alt="Contributing notice">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 123. Opening a Pull Request when a CONTRIBUTING file exists.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea here is that you can specify specific things you want or don&#8217;t want in a Pull Request sent to your project.
This way people may actually read the guidelines before opening the Pull Request.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_project_administration">Project Administration</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally there are not a lot of administrative things you can do with a single project, but there are a couple of items that might be of interest.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_changing_the_default_branch">Changing the Default Branch</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are using a branch other than &#8220;master&#8221; as your default branch that you want people to open Pull Requests on or see by default, you can change that in your repository&#8217;s settings page under the &#8220;Options&#8221; tab.</p>
</div>
<div id="_default_branch" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/maint-10-default-branch.png" alt="Default branch">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 124. Change the default branch for a project.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Simply change the default branch in the dropdown and that will be the default for all major operations from then on, including which branch is checked out by default when someone clones the repository.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_transferring_a_project">Transferring a Project</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you would like to transfer a project to another user or an organization in GitHub, there is a &#8220;Transfer ownership&#8221; option at the bottom of the same &#8220;Options&#8221; tab of your repository settings page that allows you to do this.</p>
</div>
<div id="_transfer_project" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/maint-11-transfer.png" alt="Transfer">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 125. Transfer a project to another GitHub user or Organization.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is helpful if you are abandoning a project and someone wants to take it over, or if your project is getting bigger and want to move it into an organization.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Not only does this move the repository along with all its watchers and stars to another place, it also sets up a redirect from your URL to the new place.
It will also redirect clones and fetches from Git, not just web requests.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_github_orgs">Managing an organization</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
In addition to single-user accounts, GitHub has what are called Organizations.
Like personal accounts, Organizational accounts have a namespace where all their projects exist, but many other things are different.
These accounts represent a group of people with shared ownership of projects, and there are many tools to manage subgroups of those people.
Normally these accounts are used for Open Source groups (such as &#8220;perl&#8221; or &#8220;rails&#8221;) or companies (such as &#8220;google&#8221; or &#8220;twitter&#8221;).</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_organization_basics">Organization Basics</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An organization is pretty easy to create; just click on the &#8220;+&#8221; icon at the top-right of any GitHub page, and select &#8220;New organization&#8221; from the menu.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/neworg.png" alt="The ``New organization'' menu item.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 126. The &#8220;New organization&#8221; menu item.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First you&#8217;ll need to name your organization and provide an email address for a main point of contact for the group.
Then you can invite other users to be co-owners of the account if you want to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Follow these steps and you&#8217;ll soon be the owner of a brand-new organization.
Like personal accounts, organizations are free if everything you plan to store there will be open source.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an owner in an organization, when you fork a repository, you&#8217;ll have the choice of forking it to your organization&#8217;s namespace.
When you create new repositories you can create them either under your personal account or under any of the organizations that you are an owner in.
You also automatically &#8220;watch&#8221; any new repository created under these organizations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Just like in <a href="#_personal_avatar">Your Avatar</a>, you can upload an avatar for your organization to personalize it a bit.
Also just like personal accounts, you have a landing page for the organization that lists all of your repositories and can be viewed by other people.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s cover some of the things that are a bit different with an organizational account.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_teams">Teams</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Organizations are associated with individual people by way of teams, which are simply a grouping of individual user accounts and repositories within the organization and what kind of access those people have in those repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, say your company has three repositories: <code>frontend</code>, <code>backend</code>, and <code>deployscripts</code>.
You&#8217;d want your HTML/CSS/JavaScript developers to have access to <code>frontend</code> and maybe <code>backend</code>, and your Operations people to have access to <code>backend</code> and <code>deployscripts</code>.
Teams make this easy, without having to manage the collaborators for every individual repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Organization page shows you a simple dashboard of all the repositories, users and teams that are under this organization.</p>
</div>
<div id="_org_page" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/orgs-01-page.png" alt="orgs 01 page">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 127. The Organization page.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To manage your Teams, you can click on the Teams sidebar on the right hand side of the page in <a href="#_org_page">The Organization page.</a>.
This will bring you to a page you can use to add members to the team, add repositories to the team or manage the settings and access control levels for the team.
Each team can have read only, read/write or administrative access to the repositories.
You can change that level by clicking the &#8220;Settings&#8221; button in <a href="#_team_page">The Team page.</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="_team_page" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/orgs-02-teams.png" alt="orgs 02 teams">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 128. The Team page.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you invite someone to a team, they will get an email letting them know they&#8217;ve been invited.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Additionally, team <code>@mentions</code> (such as <code>@acmecorp/frontend</code>) work much the same as they do with individual users, except that <strong>all</strong> members of the team are then subscribed to the thread.
This is useful if you want the attention from someone on a team, but you don&#8217;t know exactly who to ask.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A user can belong to any number of teams, so don&#8217;t limit yourself to only access-control teams.
Special-interest teams like <code>ux</code>, <code>css</code>, or <code>refactoring</code> are useful for certain kinds of questions, and others like <code>legal</code> and <code>colorblind</code> for an entirely different kind.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_audit_log">Audit Log</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Organizations also give owners access to all the information about what went on under the organization.
You can go to the <em>Audit Log</em> tab and see what events have happened at an organization level, who did them and where in the world they were done.</p>
</div>

<h3 id="_scripting_github">Scripting GitHub</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So now we&#8217;ve covered all of the major features and workflows of GitHub, but any large group or project will have customizations they may want to make or external services they may want to integrate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Luckily for us, GitHub is really quite hackable in many ways.
In this section we&#8217;ll cover how to use the GitHub hooks system and its API to make GitHub work how we want it to.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_services_and_hooks">Services and Hooks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Hooks and Services section of GitHub repository administration is the easiest way to have GitHub interact with external systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_services">Services</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First we&#8217;ll take a look at Services.
Both the Hooks and Services integrations can be found in the Settings section of your repository, where we previously looked at adding Collaborators and changing the default branch of your project.
Under the &#8220;Webhooks and Services&#8221; tab you will see something like <a href="#_services_hooks">Services and Hooks configuration section.</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="_services_hooks" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/scripting-01-services.png" alt="Services and hooks">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 130. Services and Hooks configuration section.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are dozens of services you can choose from, most of them integrations into other commercial and open source systems.
Most of them are for Continuous Integration services, bug and issue trackers, chat room systems and documentation systems.
We&#8217;ll walk through setting up a very simple one, the Email hook.
If you choose &#8220;email&#8221; from the &#8220;Add Service&#8221; dropdown, you&#8217;ll get a configuration screen like <a href="#_service_config">Email service configuration.</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="_service_config" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/scripting-02-email-service.png" alt="Email service">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 131. Email service configuration.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, if we hit the &#8220;Add service&#8221; button, the email address we specified will get an email every time someone pushes to the repository.
Services can listen for lots of different types of events, but most only listen for push events and then do something with that data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If there is a system you are using that you would like to integrate with GitHub, you should check here to see if there is an existing service integration available.
For example, if you&#8217;re using Jenkins to run tests on your codebase, you can enable the Jenkins builtin service integration to kick off a test run every time someone pushes to your repository.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_hooks_2">Hooks</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you need something more specific or you want to integrate with a service or site that is not included in this list, you can instead use the more generic hooks system.
GitHub repository hooks are pretty simple.
You specify a URL and GitHub will post an HTTP payload to that URL on any event you want.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally the way this works is you can setup a small web service to listen for a GitHub hook payload and then do something with the data when it is received.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To enable a hook, you click the &#8220;Add webhook&#8221; button in <a href="#_services_hooks">Services and Hooks configuration section.</a>.
This will bring you to a page that looks like <a href="#_web_hook">Web hook configuration.</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="_web_hook" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/scripting-03-webhook.png" alt="Web hook">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 132. Web hook configuration.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The configuration for a web hook is pretty simple.
In most cases you simply enter a URL and a secret key and hit &#8220;Add webhook&#8221;.
There are a few options for which events you want GitHub to send you a payload for&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the default is to only get a payload for the <code>push</code> event, when someone pushes new code to any branch of your repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s see a small example of a web service you may set up to handle a web hook.
We&#8217;ll use the Ruby web framework Sinatra since it&#8217;s fairly concise and you should be able to easily see what we&#8217;re doing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s say we want to get an email if a specific person pushes to a specific branch of our project modifying a specific file.
We could fairly easily do that with code like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">require 'sinatra'
require 'json'
require 'mail'

post '/payload' do
  push = JSON.parse(request.body.read) # parse the JSON

  # gather the data we're looking for
  pusher = push["pusher"]["name"]
  branch = push["ref"]

  # get a list of all the files touched
  files = push["commits"].map do |commit|
    commit['added'] + commit['modified'] + commit['removed']
  end
  files = files.flatten.uniq

  # check for our criteria
  if pusher == 'schacon' &amp;&amp;
     branch == 'ref/heads/special-branch' &amp;&amp;
     files.include?('special-file.txt')

    Mail.deliver do
      from     'tchacon@example.com'
      to       'tchacon@example.com'
      subject  'Scott Changed the File'
      body     "ALARM"
    end
  end
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here we&#8217;re taking the JSON payload that GitHub delivers us and looking up who pushed it, what branch they pushed to and what files were touched in all the commits that were pushed.
Then we check that against our criteria and send an email if it matches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to develop and test something like this, you have a nice developer console in the same screen where you set the hook up.
You can see the last few deliveries that GitHub has tried to make for that webhook.
For each hook you can dig down into when it was delivered, if it was successful and the body and headers for both the request and the response.
This makes it incredibly easy to test and debug your hooks.</p>

<p>The other great feature of this is that you can redeliver any of the payloads to test your service easily.</p>

<h4 id="_the_github_api">The GitHub API</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Services and hooks give you a way to receive push notifications about events that happen on your repositories, but what if you need more information about these events?
What if you need to automate something like adding collaborators or labeling issues?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is where the GitHub API comes in handy.
GitHub has tons of API endpoints for doing nearly anything you can do on the website in an automated fashion.
In this section we&#8217;ll learn how to authenticate and connect to the API, how to comment on an issue and how to change the status of a Pull Request through the API.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_basic_usage_2">Basic Usage</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most basic thing you can do is a simple GET request on an endpoint that doesn&#8217;t require authentication.
This could be a user or read-only information on an open source project.
For example, if we want to know more about a user named &#8220;schacon&#8221;, we can run something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-javascript" data-lang="javascript">$ curl https://api.github.com/users/schacon

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are tons of endpoints like this to get information about organizations, projects, issues, commits&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;just about anything you can publicly see on GitHub.

<h4 id="_commenting_on_an_issue">Commenting on an Issue</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, if you want to do an action on the website such as comment on an Issue or Pull Request or if you want to view or interact with private content, you&#8217;ll need to authenticate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are several ways to authenticate.
You can use basic authentication with just your username and password, but generally it&#8217;s a better idea to use a personal access token.
You can generate this from the &#8220;Applications&#8221; tab of your settings page.</p>
</div>
<div id="_access_token" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/scripting-05-access-token.png" alt="Access Token">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 134. Generate your access token from the &#8220;Applications&#8221; tab of your settings page.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It will ask you which scopes you want for this token and a description.
Make sure to use a good description so you feel comfortable removing the token when your script or application is no longer used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GitHub will only show you the token once, so be sure to copy it.
You can now use this to authenticate in your script instead of using a username and password.
This is nice because you can limit the scope of what you want to do and the token is revocable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This also has the added advantage of increasing your rate limit.
Without authenticating, you will be limited to 60 requests per hour.
If you authenticate you can make up to 5,000 requests per hour.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So let&#8217;s use it to make a comment on one of our issues.
Let&#8217;s say we want to leave a comment on a specific issue, Issue #6.
To do so we have to do an HTTP POST request to <code>repos/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/issues/&lt;num&gt;/comments</code> with the token we just generated as an Authorization header.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

<p>You can use the API to do just about anything you can do on the website&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;creating and setting milestones, assigning people to Issues and Pull Requests, creating and changing labels, accessing commit data, creating new commits and branches, opening, closing or merging Pull Requests, creating and editing teams, commenting on lines of code in a Pull Request, searching the site and on and on.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_changing_the_status_of_a_pull_request">Changing the Status of a Pull Request</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is one final example we&#8217;ll look at since it&#8217;s really useful if you&#8217;re working with Pull Requests.
Each commit can have one or more statuses associated with it and there is an API to add and query that status.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of the Continuous Integration and testing services make use of this API to react to pushes by testing the code that was pushed, and then report back if that commit has passed all the tests.
You could also use this to check if the commit message is properly formatted, if the submitter followed all your contribution guidelines, if the commit was validly signed&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;any number of things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s say you set up a webhook on your repository that hits a small web service that checks for a <code>Signed-off-by</code> string in the commit message.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">require 'httparty'
require 'sinatra'
require 'json'

post '/payload' do
  push = JSON.parse(request.body.read) # parse the JSON
  repo_name = push['repository']['full_name']

  # look through each commit message
  push["commits"].each do |commit|

    # look for a Signed-off-by string
    if /Signed-off-by/.match commit['message']
      state = 'success'
      description = 'Successfully signed off!'
    else
      state = 'failure'
      description = 'No signoff found.'
    end

    # post status to GitHub
    sha = commit["id"]
    status_url = "https://api.github.com/repos/#{repo_name}/statuses/#{sha}"

    status = {
      "state"       =&gt; state,
      "description" =&gt; description,
      "target_url"  =&gt; "http://example.com/how-to-signoff",
      "context"     =&gt; "validate/signoff"
    }
    HTTParty.post(status_url,
      :body =&gt; status.to_json,
      :headers =&gt; {
        'Content-Type'  =&gt; 'application/json',
        'User-Agent'    =&gt; 'tonychacon/signoff',
        'Authorization' =&gt; "token #{ENV['TOKEN']}" }
    )
  end
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hopefully this is fairly simple to follow.
In this web hook handler we look through each commit that was just pushed, we look for the string <em>Signed-off-by</em> in the commit message and finally we POST via HTTP to the <code>/repos/&lt;user&gt;/&lt;repo&gt;/statuses/&lt;commit_sha&gt;</code> API endpoint with the status.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case you can send a state (<em>success</em>, <em>failure</em>, <em>error</em>), a description of what happened, a target URL the user can go to for more information and a &#8220;context&#8221; in case there are multiple statuses for a single commit.
For example, a testing service may provide a status and a validation service like this may also provide a status&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;the &#8220;context&#8221; field is how they&#8217;re differentiated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If someone opens a new Pull Request on GitHub and this hook is set up, you may see something like <a href="#_commit_status">Commit status via the API.</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="_commit_status" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/scripting-07-status.png" alt="Commit status">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 136. Commit status via the API.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can now see a little green check mark next to the commit that has a &#8220;Signed-off-by&#8221; string in the message and a red cross through the one where the author forgot to sign off.
You can also see that the Pull Request takes the status of the last commit on the branch and warns you if it is a failure.
This is really useful if you&#8217;re using this API for test results so you don&#8217;t accidentally merge something where the last commit is failing tests.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_octokit">Octokit</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though we&#8217;ve been doing nearly everything through <code>curl</code> and simple HTTP requests in these examples, several open-source libraries exist that make this API available in a more idiomatic way.
At the time of this writing, the supported languages include Go, Objective-C, Ruby, and .NET.
Check out <a href="http://github.com/octokit" class="bare">http://github.com/octokit</a> for more information on these, as they handle much of the HTTP for you.</p>

<h4 id="_single_revisions">Single Revisions</h4>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_short_sha_1">Short SHA-1</h4>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git can figure out a short, unique abbreviation for your SHA-1 values.
If you pass <code>--abbrev-commit</code> to the <code>git log</code> command, the output will use shorter values but keep them unique; it defaults to using seven characters but makes them longer if necessary to keep the SHA-1 unambiguous:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Generally, eight to ten characters are more than enough to be unique within a project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As an example, the Linux kernel, which is a pretty large project with over 450k commits and 3.6 million objects, has no two objects whose SHA-1s overlap more than the first 11 characters.</p>

<div class="title">A SHORT NOTE ABOUT SHA-1</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A lot of people become concerned at some point that they will, by random happenstance, have two objects in their repository that hash to the same SHA-1 value.
What then?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you do happen to commit an object that hashes to the same SHA-1 value as a previous object in your repository, Git will see the previous object already in your Git database and assume it was already written.
If you try to check out that object again at some point, you’ll always get the data of the first object.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, you should be aware of how ridiculously unlikely this scenario is.
The SHA-1 digest is 20 bytes or 160 bits.
The number of randomly hashed objects needed to ensure a 50% probability of a single collision is about 2<sup>80</sup>
(the formula for determining collision probability is <code>p = (n(n-1)/2) * (1/2^160))</code>. 2<sup>80</sup>
is 1.2 x 10<sup>24</sup>
or 1 million billion billion.
That’s 1,200 times the number of grains of sand on the earth.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here’s an example to give you an idea of what it would take to get a SHA-1 collision.
If all 6.5 billion humans on Earth were programming, and every second, each one was producing code that was the equivalent of the entire Linux kernel history (3.6 million Git objects) and pushing it into one enormous Git repository, it would take roughly 2 years until that repository contained enough objects to have a 50% probability of a single SHA-1 object collision.
A higher probability exists that every member of your programming team will be attacked and killed by wolves in unrelated incidents on the same night.</p>

<h4 id="_branch_references">Branch References</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most straightforward way to specify a commit requires that it has a branch reference pointed at it.
Then, you can use a branch name in any Git command that expects a commit object or SHA-1 value.
For instance, if you want to show the last commit object on a branch, the following commands are equivalent, assuming that the <code>topic1</code> branch points to <code>ca82a6d</code>:</p>

<p>If you want to see which specific SHA-1 a branch points to, or if you want to see what any of these examples boils down to in terms of SHA-1s, you can use a Git plumbing tool called <code>rev-parse</code>.
You can see <a href="#_git_internals">Git Internals</a> for more information about plumbing tools; basically, <code>rev-parse</code> exists for lower-level operations and isn’t designed to be used in day-to-day operations.
However, it can be helpful sometimes when you need to see what’s really going on.
Here you can run <code>rev-parse</code> on your branch.</p>

<h4 id="_git_reflog">RefLog Shortnames</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the things Git does in the background while you’re working away is keep a &#8220;reflog&#8221; – a log of where your HEAD and branch references have been for the last few months.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see your reflog by using <code>git reflog</code>:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Every time your branch tip is updated for any reason, Git stores that information for you in this temporary history.
And you can specify older commits with this data, as well.
If you want to see the fifth prior value of the HEAD of your repository, you can use the <code>@{n}</code> reference that you see in the reflog output:</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git show HEAD@{5}</code></pre>

<p>You can also use this syntax to see where a branch was some specific amount of time ago.

<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git show master@{yesterday}</code></pre>

<p>It’s important to note that the reflog information is strictly local – it’s a log of what you’ve done in your repository.
The references won’t be the same on someone else’s copy of the repository; and right after you initially clone a repository, you&#8217;ll have an empty reflog, as no activity has occurred yet in your repository.
Running <code>git show HEAD@{2.months.ago}</code> will work only if you cloned the project at least two months ago – if you cloned it five minutes ago, you’ll get no results.</p>

<h4 id="_ancestry_references">Ancestry References</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other main way to specify a commit is via its ancestry.
If you place a <code>^</code> at the end of a reference, Git resolves it to mean the parent of that commit.
Suppose you look at the history of your project:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, you can see the previous commit by specifying <code>HEAD^</code>, which means &#8220;the parent of HEAD&#8221;:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also specify a number after the <code>^</code> – for example, <code>d921970^2</code> means &#8220;the second parent of d921970.&#8221;
This syntax is only useful for merge commits, which have more than one parent.
The first parent is the branch you were on when you merged, and the second is the commit on the branch that you merged in:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other main ancestry specification is the <code>~</code>.
This also refers to the first parent, so <code>HEAD~</code> and <code>HEAD^</code> are equivalent.
The difference becomes apparent when you specify a number.
<code>HEAD~2</code> means &#8220;the first parent of the first parent,&#8221; or &#8220;the grandparent&#8221; – it traverses the first parents the number of times you specify.
For example, in the history listed earlier, <code>HEAD~3</code> would be</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_commit_ranges">Commit Ranges</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you can specify individual commits, let’s see how to specify ranges of commits.
This is particularly useful for managing your branches – if you have a lot of branches, you can use range specifications to answer questions such as, &#8220;What work is on this branch that I haven’t yet merged into my main branch?&#8221;</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_double_dot">Double Dot</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The most common range specification is the double-dot syntax.
This basically asks Git to resolve a range of commits that are reachable from one commit but aren’t reachable from another.
For example, say you have a commit history that looks like <a href="#double_dot">Example history for range selection.</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="double_dot" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/double-dot.png" alt="Example history for range selection.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 137. Example history for range selection.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You want to see what is in your experiment branch that hasn’t yet been merged into your master branch.
You can ask Git to show you a log of just those commits with <code>master..experiment</code> – that means &#8220;all commits reachable by experiment that aren’t reachable by master.&#8221;
For the sake of brevity and clarity in these examples, I’ll use the letters of the commit objects from the diagram in place of the actual log output in the order that they would display:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log master..experiment
D
C</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If, on the other hand, you want to see the opposite – all commits in <code>master</code> that aren’t in <code>experiment</code> – you can reverse the branch names.
<code>experiment..master</code> shows you everything in <code>master</code> not reachable from <code>experiment</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log experiment..master
F
E</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is useful if you want to keep the <code>experiment</code> branch up to date and preview what you’re about to merge in.
Another very frequent use of this syntax is to see what you’re about to push to a remote:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log origin/master..HEAD</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command shows you any commits in your current branch that aren’t in the <code>master</code> branch on your <code>origin</code> remote.
If you run a <code>git push</code> and your current branch is tracking <code>origin/master</code>, the commits listed by <code>git log origin/master..HEAD</code> are the commits that will be transferred to the server.
You can also leave off one side of the syntax to have Git assume HEAD.
For example, you can get the same results as in the previous example by typing <code>git log origin/master..</code> – Git substitutes HEAD if one side is missing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_multiple_points">Multiple Points</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The double-dot syntax is useful as a shorthand; but perhaps you want to specify more than two branches to indicate your revision, such as seeing what commits are in any of several branches that aren’t in the branch you’re currently on.
Git allows you to do this by using either the <code>^</code> character or <code>--not</code> before any reference from which you don’t want to see reachable commits.
Thus these three commands are equivalent:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log refA..refB
$ git log ^refA refB
$ git log refB --not refA</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is nice because with this syntax you can specify more than two references in your query, which you cannot do with the double-dot syntax.
For instance, if you want to see all commits that are reachable from <code>refA</code> or <code>refB</code> but not from <code>refC</code>, you can type one of these:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log refA refB ^refC
$ git log refA refB --not refC</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This makes for a very powerful revision query system that should help you figure out what is in your branches.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_triple_dot">Triple Dot</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last major range-selection syntax is the triple-dot syntax, which specifies all the commits that are reachable by either of two references but not by both of them.
Look back at the example commit history in <a href="#double_dot">Example history for range selection.</a>.
If you want to see what is in <code>master</code> or <code>experiment</code> but not any common references, you can run</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log master...experiment
F
E
D
C</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, this gives you normal <code>log</code> output but shows you only the commit information for those four commits, appearing in the traditional commit date ordering.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A common switch to use with the <code>log</code> command in this case is <code>--left-right</code>, which shows you which side of the range each commit is in.
This helps make the data more useful:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log --left-right master...experiment
&lt; F
&lt; E
&gt; D
&gt; C</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With these tools, you can much more easily let Git know what commit or commits you want to inspect.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_interactive_staging">Interactive Staging</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git comes with a couple of scripts that make some command-line tasks easier.
Here, you’ll look at a few interactive commands that can help you easily craft your commits to include only certain combinations and parts of files.
These tools are very helpful if you modify a bunch of files and then decide that you want those changes to be in several focused commits rather than one big messy commit.
This way, you can make sure your commits are logically separate changesets and can be easily reviewed by the developers working with you.
If you run <code>git add</code> with the <code>-i</code> or <code>--interactive</code> option, Git goes into an interactive shell mode, displaying something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often, when you’ve been working on part of your project, things are in a messy state and you want to switch branches for a bit to work on something else.
The problem is, you don’t want to do a commit of half-done work just so you can get back to this point later.
The answer to this issue is the <code>git stash</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Stashing takes the dirty state of your working directory – that is, your modified tracked files and staged changes – and saves it on a stack of unfinished changes that you can reapply at any time.</p>

<h4 id="_stashing_your_work">Stashing Your Work</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To demonstrate, you’ll go into your project and start working on a couple of files and possibly stage one of the changes.

You can reapply the one you just stashed by using the command shown in the help output of the original stash command: <code>git stash apply</code>.
If you want to apply one of the older stashes, you can specify it by naming it, like this: <code>git stash apply stash@{2}</code>.
If you don’t specify a stash, Git assumes the most recent stash and tries to apply it:</p>

<p>You can see that Git re-modifies the files you reverted when you saved the stash.
In this case, you had a clean working directory when you tried to apply the stash, and you tried to apply it on the same branch you saved it from; but having a clean working directory and applying it on the same branch aren’t necessary to successfully apply a stash.
You can save a stash on one branch, switch to another branch later, and try to reapply the changes.
You can also have modified and uncommitted files in your working directory when you apply a stash – Git gives you merge conflicts if anything no longer applies cleanly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The changes to your files were reapplied, but the file you staged before wasn’t restaged.
To do that, you must run the <code>git stash apply</code> command with a <code>--index</code> option to tell the command to try to reapply the staged changes.
If you had run that instead, you’d have gotten back to your original position:</p>

<p>If you stash some work, leave it there for a while, and continue on the branch from which you stashed the work, you may have a problem reapplying the work.

If you want an easier way to test the stashed changes again, you can run <code>git stash branch</code>, which creates a new branch for you, checks out the commit you were on when you stashed your work, reapplies your work there, and then drops the stash if it applies successfully:</p>

<h4 id="_git_clean">Cleaning your Working Directory</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, you may not want to stash some work or files in your working directory, but simply get rid of them.
The <code>git clean</code> command will do this for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some common reasons for this might be to remove cruft that has been generated by merges or external tools or to remove build artifacts in order to run a clean build.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll want to be pretty careful with this command, since it&#8217;s designed to remove files from your working directory that are not tracked.
If you change your mind, there is often no retrieving the content of those files.
A safer option is to run <code>git stash --all</code> to remove everything but save it in a stash.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Assuming you do want to remove cruft files or clean your working directory, you can do so with <code>git clean</code>.
To remove all the untracked files in your working directory, you can run <code>git clean -f -d</code>, which removes any files and also any subdirectories that become empty as a result.
The <code>-f</code> means <em>force</em> or "really do this".</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you ever want to see what it would do, you can run the command with the <code>-n</code> option, which means &#8220;do a dry run and tell me what you <em>would</em> have removed&#8221;.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clean -d -n

Would remove tmp/</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, the <code>git clean</code> command will only remove untracked files that are not ignored.
Any file that matches a pattern in your <code>.gitignore</code> or other ignore files will not be removed.
If you want to remove those files too, such as to remove all <code>.o</code> files generated from a build so you can do a fully clean build, you can add a <code>-x</code> to the clean command.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don&#8217;t know what the <code>git clean</code> command is going to do, always run it with a <code>-n</code> first to double check before changing the <code>-n</code> to a <code>-f</code> and doing it for real.
The other way you can be careful about the process is to run it with the <code>-i</code> or &#8220;interactive&#8221; flag.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will run the clean command in an interactive mode.</p>

<p>You can also look for complex combinations of strings with the <code>--and</code> flag, which makes sure that multiple matches are in the same line.
For instance, let&#8217;s look for any lines that define a constant with either the strings &#8220;LINK&#8221; or &#8220;BUF_MAX&#8221; in them in the Git codebase in an older 1.8.0 version.</p>

<p>The <code>git grep</code> command has a few advantages over normal searching commands like <code>grep</code> and <code>ack</code>.
The first is that it&#8217;s really fast, the second is that you can search through any tree in Git, not just the working directory.
As we saw in the above example, we looked for terms in an older version of the Git source code, not the version that was currently checked out.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_log_searching">Git Log Searching</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Perhaps you&#8217;re looking not for <strong>where</strong> a term exists, but <strong>when</strong> it existed or was introduced.
The <code>git log</code> command has a number of powerful tools for finding specific commits by the content of their messages or even the content of the diff they introduce.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we want to find out for example when the <code>ZLIB_BUF_MAX</code> constant was originally introduced, we can tell Git to only show us the commits that either added or removed that string with the <code>-S</code> option.</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we look at the diff of those commits we can see that in <code>ef49a7a</code> the constant was introduced and in <code>e01503b</code> it was modified.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you need to be more specific, you can provide a regular expression to search for with the <code>-G</code> option.</p>

It is called with the <code>-L</code> option to <code>git log</code> and will show you the history of a function or line of code in your codebase.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if we wanted to see every change made to the function <code>git_deflate_bound</code> in the <code>zlib.c</code> file, we could run <code>git log -L :git_deflate_bound:zlib.c</code>.

<h3 id="_rewriting_history">Rewriting History</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many times, when working with Git, you may want to revise your commit history for some reason.
One of the great things about Git is that it allows you to make decisions at the last possible moment.
You can decide what files go into which commits right before you commit with the staging area, you can decide that you didn’t mean to be working on something yet with the stash command, and you can rewrite commits that already happened so they look like they happened in a different way.
This can involve changing the order of the commits, changing messages or modifying files in a commit, squashing together or splitting apart commits, or removing commits entirely – all before you share your work with others.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, you’ll cover how to accomplish these very useful tasks so that you can make your commit history look the way you want before you share it with others.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_amend">Changing the Last Commit</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Changing your last commit is probably the most common rewriting of history that you’ll do.
You’ll often want to do two basic things to your last commit: change the commit message, or change the snapshot you just recorded by adding, changing and removing files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you only want to modify your last commit message, it’s very simple:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git commit --amend</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That drops you into your text editor, which has your last commit message in it, ready for you to modify the message.
When you save and close the editor, the editor writes a new commit containing that message and makes it your new last commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you’ve committed and then you want to change the snapshot you committed by adding or changing files, possibly because you forgot to add a newly created file when you originally committed, the process works basically the same way.
You stage the changes you want by editing a file and running <code>git add</code> on it or <code>git rm</code> to a tracked file, and the subsequent <code>git commit --amend</code> takes your current staging area and makes it the snapshot for the new commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need to be careful with this technique because amending changes the SHA-1 of the commit.
It’s like a very small rebase – don’t amend your last commit if you’ve already pushed it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_changing_multiple">Changing Multiple Commit Messages</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To modify a commit that is farther back in your history, you must move to more complex tools.
Git doesn’t have a modify-history tool, but you can use the rebase tool to rebase a series of commits onto the HEAD they were originally based on instead of moving them to another one.
With the interactive rebase tool, you can then stop after each commit you want to modify and change the message, add files, or do whatever you wish.
You can run rebase interactively by adding the <code>-i</code> option to <code>git rebase</code>.
You must indicate how far back you want to rewrite commits by telling the command which commit to rebase onto.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, if you want to change the last three commit messages, or any of the commit messages in that group, you supply as an argument to <code>git rebase -i</code> the parent of the last commit you want to edit, which is <code>HEAD~2^</code> or <code>HEAD~3</code>.
It may be easier to remember the <code>~3</code> because you’re trying to edit the last three commits; but keep in mind that you’re actually designating four commits ago, the parent of the last commit you want to edit:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git rebase -i HEAD~3</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember again that this is a rebasing command – every commit included in the range <code>HEAD~3..HEAD</code> will be rewritten, whether you change the message or not.
Don’t include any commit you’ve already pushed to a central server – doing so will confuse other developers by providing an alternate version of the same change.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Running this command gives you a list of commits in your text editor that looks something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
pick 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick a5f4a0d added cat-file

# Rebase 710f0f8..a5f4a0d onto 710f0f8
#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s important to note that these commits are listed in the opposite order than you normally see them using the <code>log</code> command.
If you run a <code>log</code>, you see something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log --pretty=format:"%h %s" HEAD~3..HEAD
a5f4a0d added cat-file
310154e updated README formatting and added blame
f7f3f6d changed my name a bit</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice the reverse order.
The interactive rebase gives you a script that it’s going to run.
It will start at the commit you specify on the command line (<code>HEAD~3</code>) and replay the changes introduced in each of these commits from top to bottom.
It lists the oldest at the top, rather than the newest, because that’s the first one it will replay.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need to edit the script so that it stops at the commit you want to edit.
To do so, change the word &#8216;pick&#8217; to the word &#8216;edit&#8217; for each of the commits you want the script to stop after.
For example, to modify only the third commit message, you change the file to look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">edit f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
pick 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick a5f4a0d added cat-file</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you save and exit the editor, Git rewinds you back to the last commit in that list and drops you on the command line with the following message:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git rebase -i HEAD~3
Stopped at f7f3f6d... changed my name a bit
You can amend the commit now, with

       git commit --amend

Once you’re satisfied with your changes, run

       git rebase --continue</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These instructions tell you exactly what to do.

<div class="listingblock">

</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git rebase --continue</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command will apply the other two commits automatically, and then you’re done.
If you change pick to edit on more lines, you can repeat these steps for each commit you change to edit.
Each time, Git will stop, let you amend the commit, and continue when you’re finished.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_reordering_commits">Reordering Commits</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also use interactive rebases to reorder or remove commits entirely.
If you want to remove the &#8220;added cat-file&#8221; commit and change the order in which the other two commits are introduced, you can change the rebase script from this</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you save and exit the editor, Git rewinds your branch to the parent of these commits, applies <code>310154e</code> and then <code>f7f3f6d</code>, and then stops.
You effectively change the order of those commits and remove the &#8220;added cat-file&#8221; commit completely.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_squashing">Squashing Commits</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It’s also possible to take a series of commits and squash them down into a single commit with the interactive rebasing tool.
The script puts helpful instructions in the rebase message:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">#
# Commands:
#  p, pick = use commit
#  r, reword = use commit, but edit the commit message
#  e, edit = use commit, but stop for amending
#  s, squash = use commit, but meld into previous commit
#  f, fixup = like "squash", but discard this commit's log message
#  x, exec = run command (the rest of the line) using shell
#
# These lines can be re-ordered; they are executed from top to bottom.
#
# If you remove a line here THAT COMMIT WILL BE LOST.
#
# However, if you remove everything, the rebase will be aborted.
#
# Note that empty commits are commented out</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If, instead of &#8220;pick&#8221; or &#8220;edit&#8221;, you specify &#8220;squash&#8221;, Git applies both that change and the change directly before it and makes you merge the commit messages together.
So, if you want to make a single commit from these three commits, you make the script look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
squash 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
squash a5f4a0d added cat-file</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you save and exit the editor, Git applies all three changes and then puts you back into the editor to merge the three commit messages:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console"># This is a combination of 3 commits.
# The first commit's message is:
changed my name a bit

# This is the 2nd commit message:

updated README formatting and added blame

# This is the 3rd commit message:

added cat-file</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you save that, you have a single commit that introduces the changes of all three previous commits.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_splitting_a_commit">Splitting a Commit</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Splitting a commit undoes a commit and then partially stages and commits as many times as commits you want to end up with.
For example, suppose you want to split the middle commit of your three commits.
Instead of &#8220;updated README formatting and added blame&#8221;, you want to split it into two commits: &#8220;updated README formatting&#8221; for the first, and &#8220;added blame&#8221; for the second.
You can do that in the <code>rebase -i</code> script by changing the instruction on the commit you want to split to &#8220;edit&#8221;:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">pick f7f3f6d changed my name a bit
edit 310154e updated README formatting and added blame
pick a5f4a0d added cat-file</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, when the script drops you to the command line, you reset that commit, take the changes that have been reset, and create multiple commits out of them.
When you save and exit the editor, Git rewinds to the parent of the first commit in your list, applies the first commit (<code>f7f3f6d</code>), applies the second (<code>310154e</code>), and drops you to the console.
There, you can do a mixed reset of that commit with <code>git reset HEAD^</code>, which effectively undoes that commit and leaves the modified files unstaged.
Now you can stage and commit files until you have several commits, and run <code>git rebase --continue</code> when you’re done:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git reset HEAD^
$ git add README
$ git commit -m 'updated README formatting'
$ git add lib/simplegit.rb
$ git commit -m 'added blame'
$ git rebase --continue</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git applies the last commit (<code>a5f4a0d</code>) in the script, and your history looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log -4 --pretty=format:"%h %s"
1c002dd added cat-file
9b29157 added blame
35cfb2b updated README formatting
f3cc40e changed my name a bit</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once again, this changes the SHA-1s of all the commits in your list, so make sure no commit shows up in that list that you’ve already pushed to a shared repository.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_nuclear_option_filter_branch">The Nuclear Option: filter-branch</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is another history-rewriting option that you can use if you need to rewrite a larger number of commits in some scriptable way – for instance, changing your email address globally or removing a file from every commit.
The command is <code>filter-branch</code>, and it can rewrite huge swaths of your history, so you probably shouldn’t use it unless your project isn’t yet public and other people haven’t based work off the commits you’re about to rewrite.
However, it can be very useful.
You’ll learn a few of the common uses so you can get an idea of some of the things it’s capable of.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_removing_file_every_commit">Removing a File from Every Commit</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This occurs fairly commonly.
Someone accidentally commits a huge binary file with a thoughtless <code>git add .</code>, and you want to remove it everywhere.
Perhaps you accidentally committed a file that contained a password, and you want to make your project open source.
<code>filter-branch</code> is the tool you probably want to use to scrub your entire history.
To remove a file named <code>passwords.txt</code> from your entire history, you can use the <code>--tree-filter</code> option to <code>filter-branch</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f passwords.txt' HEAD

Ref 'refs/heads/master' was rewritten</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>--tree-filter</code> option runs the specified command after each checkout of the project and then recommits the results.
In this case, you remove a file called <code>passwords.txt</code> from every snapshot, whether it exists or not.
If you want to remove all accidentally committed editor backup files, you can run something like <code>git filter-branch --tree-filter 'rm -f *~' HEAD</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You’ll be able to watch Git rewriting trees and commits and then move the branch pointer at the end.
It’s generally a good idea to do this in a testing branch and then hard-reset your master branch after you’ve determined the outcome is what you really want.
To run <code>filter-branch</code> on all your branches, you can pass <code>--all</code> to the command.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_making_a_subdirectory_the_new_root">Making a Subdirectory the New Root</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose you’ve done an import from another source control system and have subdirectories that make no sense (<code>trunk</code>, <code>tags</code>, and so on).
If you want to make the <code>trunk</code> subdirectory be the new project root for every commit, <code>filter-branch</code> can help you do that, too:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git filter-branch --subdirectory-filter trunk HEAD

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now your new project root is what was in the <code>trunk</code> subdirectory each time.
Git will also automatically remove commits that did not affect the subdirectory.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_changing_email_addresses_globally">Changing Email Addresses Globally</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another common case is that you forgot to run <code>git config</code> to set your name and email address before you started working, or perhaps you want to open-source a project at work and change all your work email addresses to your personal address.
In any case, you can change email addresses in multiple commits in a batch with <code>filter-branch</code> as well.
You need to be careful to change only the email addresses that are yours, so you use <code>--commit-filter</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git filter-branch --commit-filter '

<h3 id="_git_reset">Reset Demystified</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Before moving on to more specialized tools, let&#8217;s talk about <code>reset</code> and <code>checkout</code>.
These commands are two of the most confusing parts of Git when you first encounter them.
They do so many things, that it seems hopeless to actually understand them and employ them properly.
For this, we recommend a simple metaphor.</p>

<h4 id="_the_three_trees">The Three Trees</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>An easier way to think about <code>reset</code> and <code>checkout</code> is through the mental frame of Git being a content manager of three different trees.
By &#8220;tree&#8221; here we really mean &#8220;collection of files&#8221;, not specifically the data structure.
(There are a few cases where the index doesn&#8217;t exactly act like a tree, but for our purposes it is easier to think about it this way for now.)</p>

<p>HEAD is the pointer to the current branch reference, which is in turn a pointer to the last commit made on that branch.
That means HEAD will be the parent of the next commit that is created.
It&#8217;s generally simplest to think of HEAD as the snapshot of <strong>your last commit</strong>.</p>

<p>In fact, it&#8217;s pretty easy to see what that snapshot looks like.

<p>The Index is your <strong>proposed next commit</strong>.

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git populates this index with a list of all the file contents that were last checked out into your working directory and what they looked like when they were originally checked out.
You then replace some of those files with new versions of them, and <code>git commit</code> converts that into the tree for a new commit.</p>

<p>Let&#8217;s visualize this process: say you go into a new directory with a single file in it.
We&#8217;ll call this <strong>v1</strong> of the file, and we&#8217;ll indicate it in blue.
Now we run <code>git init</code>, which will create a Git repository with a HEAD reference which points to an unborn branch (<code>master</code> doesn&#8217;t exist yet).</p>

<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">

<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-ex2.png" alt="reset ex2">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we want to make a change to that file and commit it.
We&#8217;ll go through the same process; first we change the file in our working directory.
Let&#8217;s call this <strong>v2</strong> of the file, and indicate it in red.</p>

<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-ex4.png" alt="reset ex4">

<p>If we run <code>git status</code> right now, we&#8217;ll see the file in red as &#8220;Changes not staged for commit,&#8221; because that entry differs between the Index and the Working Directory.

<p>Switching branches or cloning goes through a similar process.
When you checkout a branch, it changes <strong>HEAD</strong> to point to the new branch ref, populates your <strong>Index</strong> with the snapshot of that commit, then copies the contents of the <strong>Index</strong> into your <strong>Working Directory</strong>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_role_of_reset">The Role of Reset</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>reset</code> command makes more sense when viewed in this context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the purposes of these examples, let&#8217;s say that we&#8217;ve modified <code>file.txt</code> again and committed it a third time.
So now our history looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-start.png" alt="reset start">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s now walk through exactly what <code>reset</code> does when you call it.
It directly manipulates these three trees in a simple and predictable way.
It does up to three basic operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_step_1_move_head">Step 1: Move HEAD</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing <code>reset</code> will do is move what HEAD points to.
This isn&#8217;t the same as changing HEAD itself (which is what <code>checkout</code> does); <code>reset</code> moves the branch that HEAD is pointing to.
This means if HEAD is set to the <code>master</code> branch (i.e. you&#8217;re currently on the <code>master</code> branch), running <code>git reset 9e5e6a4</code> will start by making <code>master</code> point to <code>9e5e6a4</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-soft.png" alt="reset soft">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No matter what form of <code>reset</code> with a commit you invoke, this is the first thing it will always try to do.
With <code>reset --soft</code>, it will simply stop there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now take a second to look at that diagram and realize what happened: it essentially undid the last <code>git commit</code> command.
When you run <code>git commit</code>, Git creates a new commit and moves the branch that HEAD points to up to it.
When you <code>reset</code> back to <code>HEAD~</code> (the parent of HEAD), you are moving the branch back to where it was, without changing the Index or Working Directory.
You could now update the Index and run <code>git commit</code> again to accomplish what <code>git commit --amend</code> would have done (see <a href="#_git_amend">Changing the Last Commit</a>).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_step_2_updating_the_index_mixed">Step 2: Updating the Index (--mixed)</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that if you run <code>git status</code> now you&#8217;ll see in green the difference between the Index and what the new HEAD is.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next thing <code>reset</code> will do is to update the Index with the contents of whatever snapshot HEAD now points to.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-mixed.png" alt="reset mixed">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you specify the <code>--mixed</code> option, <code>reset</code> will stop at this point.
This is also the default, so if you specify no option at all (just <code>git reset HEAD~</code> in this case), this is where the command will stop.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now take another second to look at that diagram and realize what happened: it still undid your last <code>commit</code>, but also <em>unstaged</em> everything.
You rolled back to before you ran all your <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> commands.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_step_3_updating_the_working_directory_hard">Step 3: Updating the Working Directory (--hard)</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third thing that <code>reset</code> will do is to make the Working Directory look like the Index.
If you use the <code>--hard</code> option, it will continue to this stage.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-hard.png" alt="reset hard">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So let&#8217;s think about what just happened.
You undid your last commit, the <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> commands, <strong>and</strong> all the work you did in your working directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that this flag (<code>--hard</code>) is the only way to make the <code>reset</code> command dangerous, and one of the very few cases where Git will actually destroy data.
Any other invocation of <code>reset</code> can be pretty easily undone, but the <code>--hard</code> option cannot, since it forcibly overwrites files in the Working Directory.
In this particular case, we still have the <strong>v3</strong> version of our file in a commit in our Git DB, and we could get it back by looking at our <code>reflog</code>, but if we had not committed it, Git still would have overwritten the file and it would be unrecoverable.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_recap">Recap</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>reset</code> command overwrites these three trees in a specific order, stopping when you tell it to:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Move the branch HEAD points to <em>(stop here if <code>--soft</code>)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the Index look like HEAD <em>(stop here unless <code>--hard</code>)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the Working Directory look like the Index</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_reset_with_a_path">Reset With a Path</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That covers the behavior of <code>reset</code> in its basic form, but you can also provide it with a path to act upon.
If you specify a path, <code>reset</code> will skip step 1, and limit the remainder of its actions to a specific file or set of files.
This actually sort of makes sense – HEAD is just a pointer, and you can&#8217;t point to part of one commit and part of another.
But the Index and Working directory <em>can</em> be partially updated, so reset proceeds with steps 2 and 3.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, assume we run <code>git reset file.txt</code>.
This form (since you did not specify a commit SHA-1 or branch, and you didn&#8217;t specify <code>--soft</code> or <code>--hard</code>) is shorthand for <code>git reset --mixed HEAD file.txt</code>, which will:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Move the branch HEAD points to <em>(skipped)</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the Index look like HEAD <em>(stop here)</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So it essentially just copies <code>file.txt</code> from HEAD to the Index.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-path1.png" alt="reset path1">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This has the practical effect of <em>unstaging</em> the file.
If we look at the diagram for that command and think about what <code>git add</code> does, they are exact opposites.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-path2.png" alt="reset path2">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is why the output of the <code>git status</code> command suggests that you run this to unstage a file.
(See <a href="#_unstaging">Unstaging a Staged File</a> for more on this.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We could just as easily not let Git assume we meant &#8220;pull the data from HEAD&#8221; by specifying a specific commit to pull that file version from.
We would just run something like <code>git reset eb43bf file.txt</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-path3.png" alt="reset path3">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This effectively does the same thing as if we had reverted the content of the file to <strong>v1</strong> in the Working Directory, ran <code>git add</code> on it, then reverted it back to <strong>v3</strong> again (without actually going through all those steps).
If we run <code>git commit</code> now, it will record a change that reverts that file back to <strong>v1</strong>, even though we never actually had it in our Working Directory again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s also interesting to note that like <code>git add</code>, the <code>reset</code> command will accept a <code>--patch</code> option to unstage content on a hunk-by-hunk basis.
So you can selectively unstage or revert content.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_squashing_2">Squashing</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s look at how to do something interesting with this newfound power – squashing commits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Say you have a series of commits with messages like &#8220;oops.&#8221;, &#8220;WIP&#8221; and &#8220;forgot this file&#8221;.
You can use <code>reset</code> to quickly and easily squash them into a single commit that makes you look really smart.
(<a href="#_squashing">Squashing Commits</a> shows another way to do this, but in this example it&#8217;s simpler to use <code>reset</code>.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s say you have a project where the first commit has one file, the second commit added a new file and changed the first, and the third commit changed the first file again.
The second commit was a work in progress and you want to squash it down.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-squash-r1.png" alt="reset squash r1">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can run <code>git reset --soft HEAD~2</code> to move the HEAD branch back to an older commit (the first commit you want to keep):</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-squash-r2.png" alt="reset squash r2">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then simply run <code>git commit</code> again:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-squash-r3.png" alt="reset squash r3">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you can see that your reachable history, the history you would push, now looks like you had one commit with <code>file-a.txt</code> v1, then a second that both modified <code>file-a.txt</code> to v3 and added <code>file-b.txt</code>.
The commit with the v2 version of the file is no longer in the history.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_check_it_out">Check It Out</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, you may wonder what the difference between <code>checkout</code> and <code>reset</code> is.
Like <code>reset</code>, <code>checkout</code> manipulates the three trees, and it is a bit different depending on whether you give the command a file path or not.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_without_paths">Without Paths</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Running <code>git checkout [branch]</code> is pretty similar to running <code>git reset --hard [branch]</code> in that it updates all three trees for you to look like <code>[branch]</code>, but there are two important differences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, unlike <code>reset --hard</code>, <code>checkout</code> is working-directory safe; it will check to make sure it&#8217;s not blowing away files that have changes to them.
Actually, it&#8217;s a bit smarter than that – it tries to do a trivial merge in the Working Directory, so all of the files you <em>haven&#8217;t</em> changed in will be updated.
<code>reset --hard</code>, on the other hand, will simply replace everything across the board without checking.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second important difference is how it updates HEAD.
Where <code>reset</code> will move the branch that HEAD points to, <code>checkout</code> will move HEAD itself to point to another branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For instance, say we have <code>master</code> and <code>develop</code> branches which point at different commits, and we&#8217;re currently on <code>develop</code> (so HEAD points to it).
If we run <code>git reset master</code>, <code>develop</code> itself will now point to the same commit that <code>master</code> does.
If we instead run <code>git checkout master</code>, <code>develop</code> does not move, HEAD itself does.
HEAD will now point to <code>master</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, in both cases we&#8217;re moving HEAD to point to commit A, but <em>how</em> we do so is very different.
<code>reset</code> will move the branch HEAD points to, <code>checkout</code> moves HEAD itself.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/reset-checkout.png" alt="reset checkout">
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_with_paths">With Paths</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other way to run <code>checkout</code> is with a file path, which, like <code>reset</code>, does not move HEAD.
It is just like <code>git reset [branch] file</code> in that it updates the index with that file at that commit, but it also overwrites the file in the working directory.
It would be exactly like <code>git reset --hard [branch] file</code> (if <code>reset</code> would let you run that) – it&#8217;s not working-directory safe, and it does not move HEAD.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Also, like <code>git reset</code> and <code>git add</code>, <code>checkout</code> will accept a <code>--patch</code> option to allow you to selectively revert file contents on a hunk-by-hunk basis.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_summary_8">Summary</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Hopefully now you understand and feel more comfortable with the <code>reset</code> command, but are probably still a little confused about how exactly it differs from <code>checkout</code> and could not possibly remember all the rules of the different invocations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s a cheat-sheet for which commands affect which trees.
The &#8220;HEAD&#8221; column reads &#8220;REF&#8221; if that command moves the reference (branch) that HEAD points to, and &#8220;HEAD&#8221; if it moves HEAD itself.
Pay especial attention to the <em>WD Safe?</em> column – if it says <strong>NO</strong>, take a second to think before running that command.</p>

<h3 id="_advanced_merging">Advanced Merging</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Merging in Git is typically fairly easy.
Since Git makes it easy to merge another branch multiple times, it means that you can have a very long lived branch but you can keep it up to date as you go, solving small conflicts often, rather than be surprised by one enormous conflict at the end of the series.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, sometimes tricky conflicts do occur.
Unlike some other version control systems, Git does not try to be overly clever about merge conflict resolution.
Git&#8217;s philosophy is to be smart about determining when a merge resolution is unambiguous, but if there is a conflict, it does not try to be clever about automatically resolving it.
Therefore, if you wait too long to merge two branches that diverge quickly, you can run into some issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this section, we&#8217;ll go over what some of those issues might be and what tools Git gives you to help handle these more tricky situations.
We&#8217;ll also cover some of the different, non-standard types of merges you can do, as well as see how to back out of merges that you&#8217;ve done.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_merge_conflicts">Merge Conflicts</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>While we covered some basics on resolving merge conflicts in <a href="#_basic_merge_conflicts">Basic Merge Conflicts</a>, for more complex conflicts, Git provides a few tools to help you figure out what&#8217;s going on and how to better deal with the conflict.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First of all, if at all possible, try to make sure your working directory is clean before doing a merge that may have conflicts.
If you have work in progress, either commit it to a temporary branch or stash it.
This makes it so that you can undo <strong>anything</strong> you try here.
If you have unsaved changes in your working directory when you try a merge, some of these tips may help you lose that work.</p>
</div>

<h5 id="_abort_merge">Aborting a Merge</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We now have a few options.
First, let&#8217;s cover how to get out of this situation.
If you perhaps weren&#8217;t expecting conflicts and don&#8217;t want to quite deal with the situation yet, you can simply back out of the merge with <code>git merge --abort</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git status -sb
## master
UU hello.rb

$ git merge --abort

$ git status -sb
## master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git merge --abort</code> option tries to revert back to your state before you ran the merge.
The only cases where it may not be able to do this perfectly would be if you had unstashed, uncommitted changes in your working directory when you ran it, otherwise it should work fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If for some reason you just want to start over, you can also run <code>git reset --hard HEAD</code>, and your repository will be back to the last committed state.
Remember that any uncommitted work will be lost, so make sure you don&#8217;t want any of your changes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_ignoring_whitespace">Ignoring Whitespace</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this specific case, the conflicts are whitespace related.
We know this because the case is simple, but it&#8217;s also pretty easy to tell in real cases when looking at the conflict because every line is removed on one side and added again on the other.
By default, Git sees all of these lines as being changed, so it can&#8217;t merge the files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default merge strategy can take arguments though, and a few of them are about properly ignoring whitespace changes.
If you see that you have a lot of whitespace issues in a merge, you can simply abort it and do it again, this time with <code>-Xignore-all-space</code> or <code>-Xignore-space-change</code>.
The first option ignores whitespace <strong>completely</strong> when comparing lines, the second treats sequences of one or more whitespace characters as equivalent.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git merge -Xignore-space-change whitespace

 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+), 1 deletion(-)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since in this case, the actual file changes were not conflicting, once we ignore the whitespace changes, everything merges just fine.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a lifesaver if you have someone on your team who likes to occasionally reformat everything from spaces to tabs or vice-versa.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_manual_remerge">Manual File Re-merging</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though Git handles whitespace pre-processing pretty well, there are other types of changes that perhaps Git can&#8217;t handle automatically, but are scriptable fixes.
As an example, let&#8217;s pretend that Git could not handle the whitespace change and we needed to do it by hand.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What we really need to do is run the file we&#8217;re trying to merge in through a <code>dos2unix</code> program before trying the actual file merge.
So how would we do that?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, we get into the merge conflict state.
Then we want to get copies of my version of the file, their version (from the branch we&#8217;re merging in) and the common version (from where both sides branched off).
Then we want to fix up either their side or our side and re-try the merge again for just this single file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Getting the three file versions is actually pretty easy.
Git stores all of these versions in the index under &#8220;stages&#8221; which each have numbers associated with them.
Stage 1 is the common ancestor, stage 2 is your version and stage 3 is from the <code>MERGE_HEAD</code>, the version you&#8217;re merging in (&#8220;theirs&#8221;).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can extract a copy of each of these versions of the conflicted file with the <code>git show</code> command and a special syntax.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git show :1:hello.rb &gt; hello.common.rb
$ git show :2:hello.rb &gt; hello.ours.rb
$ git show :3:hello.rb &gt; hello.theirs.rb</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to get a little more hard core, you can also use the <code>ls-files -u</code> plumbing command to get the actual SHA-1s of the Git blobs for each of these files.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git ls-files -u
100755 ac51efdc3df4f4fd328d1a02ad05331d8e2c9111 1	hello.rb

100755 e85207e04dfdd5eb0a1e9febbc67fd837c44a1cd 3	hello.rb</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>:1:hello.rb</code> is just a shorthand for looking up that blob SHA-1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that we have the content of all three stages in our working directory, we can manually fix up theirs to fix the whitespace issue and re-merge the file with the little-known <code>git merge-file</code> command which does just that.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ dos2unix hello.theirs.rb

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point we have nicely merged the file.
In fact, this actually works better than the <code>ignore-space-change</code> option because this actually fixes the whitespace changes before merge instead of simply ignoring them.
In the <code>ignore-space-change</code> merge, we actually ended up with a few lines with DOS line endings, making things mixed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to get an idea before finalizing this commit about what was actually changed between one side or the other, you can ask <code>git diff</code> to compare what is in your working directory that you&#8217;re about to commit as the result of the merge to any of these stages.
Let&#8217;s go through them all.</p>

<p>We would like to see what the merge conflict is.
If we open up the file, we&#8217;ll see something like this:</p>

&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; mundo
end

hello()</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both sides of the merge added content to this file, but some of the commits modified the file in the same place that caused this conflict.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s explore a couple of tools that you now have at your disposal to determine how this conflict came to be.
Perhaps it&#8217;s not obvious how exactly you should fix this conflict.
You need more context.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One helpful tool is <code>git checkout</code> with the &#8216;--conflict&#8217; option.
This will re-checkout the file again and replace the merge conflict markers.
This can be useful if you want to reset the markers and try to resolve them again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can pass <code>--conflict</code> either <code>diff3</code> or <code>merge</code> (which is the default).
If you pass it <code>diff3</code>, Git will use a slightly different version of conflict markers, not only giving you the &#8220;ours&#8221; and &#8220;theirs&#8221; versions, but also the &#8220;base&#8221; version inline to give you more context.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout --conflict=diff3 hello.rb</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once we run that, the file will look like this instead:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">#! /usr/bin/env ruby

def hello
&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; ours
  puts 'hola world'
||||||| base
  puts 'hello world'
=======
  puts 'hello mundo'
&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;&gt; theirs
end

hello()</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you like this format, you can set it as the default for future merge conflicts by setting the <code>merge.conflictstyle</code> setting to <code>diff3</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global merge.conflictstyle diff3</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git checkout</code> command can also take <code>--ours</code> and <code>--theirs</code> options, which can be a really fast way of just choosing either one side or the other without merging things at all.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can be particularly useful for conflicts of binary files where you can simply choose one side, or where you only want to merge certain files in from another branch - you can do the merge and then checkout certain files from one side or the other before committing.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_merge_log">Merge Log</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another useful tool when resolving merge conflicts is <code>git log</code>.
This can help you get context on what may have contributed to the conflicts.
Reviewing a little bit of history to remember why two lines of development were touching the same area of code can be really helpful sometimes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get a full list of all of the unique commits that were included in either branch involved in this merge, we can use the &#8220;triple dot&#8221; syntax that we learned in <a href="#_triple_dot">Triple Dot</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log --oneline --left-right HEAD...MERGE_HEAD

&gt; 7cff591 add testing script
&gt; c3ffff1 changed text to hello mundo</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s a nice list of the six total commits involved, as well as which line of development each commit was on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We can further simplify this though to give us much more specific context.
If we add the <code>--merge</code> option to <code>git log</code>, it will only show the commits in either side of the merge that touch a file that&#8217;s currently conflicted.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log --oneline --left-right --merge
&lt; 694971d update phrase to hola world
&gt; c3ffff1 changed text to hello mundo</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you run that with the <code>-p</code> option instead, you get just the diffs to the file that ended up in conflict.
This can be <strong>really</strong> helpful in quickly giving you the context you need to help understand why something conflicts and how to more intelligently resolve it.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_combined_diff_format">Combined Diff Format</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Since Git stages any merge results that are successful, when you run <code>git diff</code> while in a conflicted merge state, you only get what is currently still in conflict.
This can be helpful to see what you still have to resolve.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you run <code>git diff</code> directly after a merge conflict, it will give you information in a rather unique diff output format.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git diff

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The format is called &#8220;Combined Diff&#8221; and gives you two columns of data next to each line.
The first column shows you if that line is different (added or removed) between the &#8220;ours&#8221; branch and the file in your working directory and the second column does the same between the &#8220;theirs&#8221; branch and your working directory copy.</p>

<p>Now that you know how to create a merge commit, you&#8217;ll probably make some by mistake.
One of the great things about working with Git is that it&#8217;s okay to make mistakes, because it&#8217;s possible (and in many cases easy) to fix them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Merge commits are no different.
Let&#8217;s say you started work on a topic branch, accidentally merged it into <code>master</code>, and now your commit history looks like this:</p>

<p>There are two ways to approach this problem, depending on what your desired outcome is.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_fix_the_references">Fix the references</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the unwanted merge commit only exists on your local repository, the easiest and best solution is to move the branches so that they point where you want them to.
In most cases, if you follow the errant <code>git merge</code> with <code>git reset --hard HEAD~</code>, this will reset the branch pointers so they look like this:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We covered <code>reset</code> back in <a href="#_git_reset">Reset Demystified</a>, so it shouldn&#8217;t be too hard to figure out what&#8217;s going on here.
Here&#8217;s a quick refresher: <code>reset --hard</code> usually goes through three steps:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Move the branch HEAD points to.
In this case, we want to move <code>master</code> to where it was before the merge commit (<code>C6</code>).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the index look like HEAD.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the working directory look like the index.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The downside of this approach is that it&#8217;s rewriting history, which can be problematic with a shared repository.
Check out <a href="#_rebase_peril">The Perils of Rebasing</a> for more on what can happen; the short version is that if other people have the commits you&#8217;re rewriting, you should probably avoid <code>reset</code>.
This approach also won&#8217;t work if any other commits have been created since the merge; moving the refs would effectively lose those changes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_reverse_commit">Reverse the commit</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If moving the branch pointers around isn&#8217;t going to work for you, Git gives you the option of making a new commit which undoes all the changes from an existing one.
Git calls this operation a &#8220;revert&#8221;, and in this particular scenario, you&#8217;d invoke it like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git revert -m 1 HEAD
[master b1d8379] Revert "Merge branch 'topic'"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>-m 1</code> flag indicates which parent is the &#8220;mainline&#8221; and should be kept.
When you invoke a merge into <code>HEAD</code> (<code>git merge topic</code>), the new commit has two parents: the first one is <code>HEAD</code> (<code>C6</code>), and the second is the tip of the branch being merged in (<code>C4</code>).
In this case, we want to undo all the changes introduced by merging in parent #2 (<code>C4</code>), while keeping all the content from parent #1 (<code>C6</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The history with the revert commit looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/undomerge-revert.png" alt="History after `git revert -m 1`.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 140. History after <code>git revert -m 1</code></div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The new commit <code>^M</code> has exactly the same contents as <code>C6</code>, so starting from here it&#8217;s as if the merge never happened, except that the now-unmerged commits are still in <code>HEAD</code>'s history.
Git will get confused if you try to merge <code>topic</code> into <code>master</code> again:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git merge topic
Already up-to-date.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s nothing in <code>topic</code> that isn&#8217;t already reachable from <code>master</code>.
What&#8217;s worse, if you add work to <code>topic</code> and merge again, Git will only bring in the changes <em>since</em> the reverted merge:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/undomerge-revert2.png" alt="History with a bad merge.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 141. History with a bad merge</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The best way around this is to un-revert the original merge, since now you want to bring in the changes that were reverted out, <strong>then</strong> create a new merge commit:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git revert ^M
[master 09f0126] Revert "Revert "Merge branch 'topic'""
$ git merge topic</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="title">Figure 142. History after re-merging a reverted merge</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, <code>M</code> and <code>^M</code> cancel out.
<code>^^M</code> effectively merges in the changes from <code>C3</code> and <code>C4</code>, and <code>C8</code> merges in the changes from <code>C7</code>, so now <code>topic</code> is fully merged.</p>

<h4 id="_other_types_of_merges">Other Types of Merges</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far we&#8217;ve covered the normal merge of two branches, normally handled with what is called the &#8220;recursive&#8221; strategy of merging.
There are other ways to merge branches together however.
Let&#8217;s cover a few of them quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_our_or_theirs_preference">Our or Theirs Preference</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First of all, there is another useful thing we can do with the normal &#8220;recursive&#8221; mode of merging.
We&#8217;ve already seen the <code>ignore-all-space</code> and <code>ignore-space-change</code> options which are passed with a <code>-X</code> but we can also tell Git to favor one side or the other when it sees a conflict.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, when Git sees a conflict between two branches being merged, it will add merge conflict markers into your code and mark the file as conflicted and let you resolve it.
If you would prefer for Git to simply choose a specific side and ignore the other side instead of letting you manually resolve the conflict, you can pass the <code>merge</code> command either a <code>-Xours</code> or <code>-Xtheirs</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If Git sees this, it will not add conflict markers.
Any differences that are mergeable, it will merge.
Any differences that conflict, it will simply choose the side you specify in whole, including binary files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we go back to the &#8220;hello world&#8221; example we were using before, we can see that merging in our branch causes conflicts.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git merge mundo
Auto-merging hello.rb
CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in hello.rb
Resolved 'hello.rb' using previous resolution.
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However if we run it with <code>-Xours</code> or <code>-Xtheirs</code> it does not.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git merge -Xours mundo
Auto-merging hello.rb
Merge made by the 'recursive' strategy.
 hello.rb | 2 +-
 test.sh  | 2 ++
 2 files changed, 3 insertions(+), 1 deletion(-)
 create mode 100644 test.sh</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In that case, instead of getting conflict markers in the file with &#8220;hello mundo&#8221; on one side and &#8220;hola world&#8221; on the other, it will simply pick &#8220;hola world&#8221;.
However, all the other non-conflicting changes on that branch are merged successfully in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This option can also be passed to the <code>git merge-file</code> command we saw earlier by running something like <code>git merge-file --ours</code> for individual file merges.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to do something like this but not have Git even try to merge changes from the other side in, there is a more draconian option, which is the &#8220;ours&#8221; merge <em>strategy</em>.
This is different from the &#8220;ours&#8221; recursive merge <em>option</em>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will basically do a fake merge.
It will record a new merge commit with both branches as parents, but it will not even look at the branch you&#8217;re merging in.
It will simply record as the result of the merge the exact code in your current branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git merge -s ours mundo
Merge made by the 'ours' strategy.
$ git diff HEAD HEAD~
$</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see that there is no difference between the branch we were on and the result of the merge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can often be useful to basically trick Git into thinking that a branch is already merged when doing a merge later on.
For example, say you branched off a <code>release</code> branch and have done some work on it that you will want to merge back into your <code>master</code> branch at some point.
In the meantime some bugfix on <code>master</code> needs to be backported into your <code>release</code> branch.
You can merge the bugfix branch into the <code>release</code> branch and also <code>merge -s ours</code> the same branch into your <code>master</code> branch (even though the fix is already there) so when you later merge the <code>release</code> branch again, there are no conflicts from the bugfix.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_subtree_merge">Subtree Merging</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The idea of the subtree merge is that you have two projects, and one of the projects maps to a subdirectory of the other one.
When you specify a subtree merge, Git is often smart enough to figure out that one is a subtree of the other and merge appropriately.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We&#8217;ll go through an example of adding a separate project into an existing project and then merging the code of the second into a subdirectory of the first.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, we&#8217;ll add the Rack application to our project.
We&#8217;ll add the Rack project as a remote reference in our own project and then check it out into its own branch:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git remote add rack_remote https://github.com/rack/rack

$ git checkout -b rack_branch rack_remote/master
Branch rack_branch set up to track remote branch refs/remotes/rack_remote/master.
Switched to a new branch "rack_branch"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we have the root of the Rack project in our <code>rack_branch</code> branch and our own project in the <code>master</code> branch.
If you check out one and then the other, you can see that they have different project roots:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ ls
AUTHORS         KNOWN-ISSUES   Rakefile      contrib         lib
COPYING         README         bin           example         test
$ git checkout master
Switched to branch "master"
$ ls
README</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is sort of a strange concept.
Not all the branches in your repository actually have to be branches of the same project.
It&#8217;s not common, because it&#8217;s rarely helpful, but it&#8217;s fairly easy to have branches contain completely different histories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, we want to pull the Rack project into our <code>master</code> project as a subdirectory.
We can do that in Git with <code>git read-tree</code>.
You’ll learn more about <code>read-tree</code> and its friends in <a href="#_git_internals">Git Internals</a>, but for now know that it reads the root tree of one branch into your current staging area and working directory.
We just switched back to your <code>master</code> branch, and we pull the <code>rack_branch</code> branch into the <code>rack</code> subdirectory of our <code>master</code> branch of our main project:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git read-tree --prefix=rack/ -u rack_branch</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we commit, it looks like we have all the Rack files under that subdirectory – as though we copied them in from a tarball.
What gets interesting is that we can fairly easily merge changes from one of the branches to the other.
So, if the Rack project updates, we can pull in upstream changes by switching to that branch and pulling:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout rack_branch
$ git pull</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, we can merge those changes back into our <code>master</code> branch.
To pull in the changes and prepopulate the commit message, use the <code>--squash</code> option, as well as the recursive merge strategy&#8217;s <code>-Xsubtree</code> option.
(The recursive strategy is the default here, but we include it for clarity.)</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout master
$ git merge --squash -s recursive -Xsubtree=rack rack_branch
Squash commit -- not updating HEAD
Automatic merge went well; stopped before committing as requested</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the changes from the Rack project are merged in and ready to be committed locally.
You can also do the opposite – make changes in the <code>rack</code> subdirectory of your master branch and then merge them into your <code>rack_branch</code> branch later to submit them to the maintainers or push them upstream.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This gives us a way to have a workflow somewhat similar to the submodule workflow without using submodules (which we will cover in <a href="#_git_submodules">Submodules</a>).
We can keep branches with other related projects in our repository and subtree merge them into our project occasionally.
It is nice in some ways, for example all the code is committed to a single place.
However, it has other drawbacks in that it&#8217;s a bit more complex and easier to make mistakes in reintegrating changes or accidentally pushing a branch into an unrelated repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another slightly weird thing is that to get a diff between what you have in your <code>rack</code> subdirectory and the code in your <code>rack_branch</code> branch – to see if you need to merge them – you can’t use the normal <code>diff</code> command.
Instead, you must run <code>git diff-tree</code> with the branch you want to compare to:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git diff-tree -p rack_branch</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Or, to compare what is in your <code>rack</code> subdirectory with what the <code>master</code> branch on the server was the last time you fetched, you can run</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git diff-tree -p rack_remote/master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_rerere">Rerere</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git rerere</code> functionality is a bit of a hidden feature.
The name stands for &#8220;reuse recorded resolution&#8221; and as the name implies, it allows you to ask Git to remember how you&#8217;ve resolved a hunk conflict so that the next time it sees the same conflict, Git can automatically resolve it for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a number of scenarios in which this functionality might be really handy.
One of the examples that is mentioned in the documentation is if you want to make sure a long lived topic branch will merge cleanly but don&#8217;t want to have a bunch of intermediate merge commits.
With <code>rerere</code> turned on you can merge occasionally, resolve the conflicts, then back out the merge.
If you do this continuously, then the final merge should be easy because <code>rerere</code> can just do everything for you automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This same tactic can be used if you want to keep a branch rebased so you don&#8217;t have to deal with the same rebasing conflicts each time you do it.
Or if you want to take a branch that you merged and fixed a bunch of conflicts and then decide to rebase it instead - you likely won&#8217;t have to do all the same conflicts again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another situation is where you merge a bunch of evolving topic branches together into a testable head occasionally, as the Git project itself often does.
If the tests fail, you can rewind the merges and re-do them without the topic branch that made the tests fail without having to re-resolve the conflicts again.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To enable the <code>rerere</code> functionality, you simply have to run this config setting:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global rerere.enabled true</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also turn it on by creating the <code>.git/rr-cache</code> directory in a specific repository, but the config setting is clearer and it can be done globally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s see a simple example, similar to our previous one.
Let&#8217;s say we have a file named <code>hello.rb</code> that looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">#! /usr/bin/env ruby

def hello
  puts 'hello world'
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In one branch we change the word &#8220;hello&#8221; to &#8220;hola&#8221;, then in another branch we change the &#8220;world&#8221; to &#8220;mundo&#8221;, just like before.</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/rerere1.png" alt="rerere1">
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When we merge the two branches together, we&#8217;ll get a merge conflict:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git merge i18n-world

Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should notice the new line <code>Recorded preimage for FILE</code> in there.
Otherwise it should look exactly like a normal merge conflict.
At this point, <code>rerere</code> can tell us a few things.
Normally, you might run <code>git status</code> at this point to see what all conflicted:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git status

#   (use "git add &lt;file&gt;..." to mark resolution)
#
#	both modified:      hello.rb
#</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, <code>git rerere</code> will also tell you what it has recorded the pre-merge state for with <code>git rerere status</code>:</p>

<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git rerere status

<p>And <code>git rerere diff</code> will show the current state of the resolution - what you started with to resolve and what you&#8217;ve resolved it to.</p>

<h3 id="_debugging_with_git">Debugging with Git</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git also provides a couple of tools to help you debug issues in your projects.
Because Git is designed to work with nearly any type of project, these tools are pretty generic, but they can often help you hunt for a bug or culprit when things go wrong.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_file_annotation">File Annotation</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you track down a bug in your code and want to know when it was introduced and why, file annotation is often your best tool.
It shows you what commit was the last to modify each line of any file.
So, if you see that a method in your code is buggy, you can annotate the file with <code>git blame</code> to see when each line of the method was last edited and by whom.
This example uses the <code>-L</code> option to limit the output to lines 12 through 22:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that the first field is the partial SHA-1 of the commit that last modified that line.
The next two fields are values extracted from that commit–the author name and the authored date of that commit – so you can easily see who modified that line and when.
After that come the line number and the content of the file.
Also note the <code>^4832fe2</code> commit lines, which designate that those lines were in this file’s original commit.
That commit is when this file was first added to this project, and those lines have been unchanged since.
This is a tad confusing, because now you’ve seen at least three different ways that Git uses the <code>^</code> to modify a commit SHA-1, but that is what it means here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another cool thing about Git is that it doesn’t track file renames explicitly.
It records the snapshots and then tries to figure out what was renamed implicitly, after the fact.
One of the interesting features of this is that you can ask it to figure out all sorts of code movement as well.
If you pass <code>-C</code> to <code>git blame</code>, Git analyzes the file you’re annotating and tries to figure out where snippets of code within it originally came from if they were copied from elsewhere.
For example, say you are refactoring a file named <code>GITServerHandler.m</code> into multiple files, one of which is <code>GITPackUpload.m</code>.
By blaming <code>GITPackUpload.m</code> with the <code>-C</code> option, you can see where sections of the code originally came from:</p>

<p>This is really useful.

<h4 id="_binary_search">Binary Search</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Annotating a file helps if you know where the issue is to begin with.
If you don’t know what is breaking, and there have been dozens or hundreds of commits since the last state where you know the code worked, you’ll likely turn to <code>git bisect</code> for help.
The <code>bisect</code> command does a binary search through your commit history to help you identify as quickly as possible which commit introduced an issue.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let’s say you just pushed out a release of your code to a production environment, you’re getting bug reports about something that wasn’t happening in your development environment, and you can’t imagine why the code is doing that.
You go back to your code, and it turns out you can reproduce the issue, but you can’t figure out what is going wrong.
You can bisect the code to find out.
First you run <code>git bisect start</code> to get things going, and then you use <code>git bisect bad</code> to tell the system that the current commit you’re on is broken.
Then, you must tell bisect when the last known good state was, using <code>git bisect good [good_commit]</code>:</p>

<p>Git figured out that about 12 commits came between the commit you marked as the last good commit (v1.0) and the current bad version, and it checked out the middle one for you.
At this point, you can run your test to see if the issue exists as of this commit.
If it does, then it was introduced sometime before this middle commit; if it doesn’t, then the problem was introduced sometime after the middle commit.
It turns out there is no issue here, and you tell Git that by typing <code>git bisect good</code> and continue your journey:</p>

<p>This is a powerful tool that can help you check hundreds of commits for an introduced bug in minutes.
In fact, if you have a script that will exit 0 if the project is good or non-0 if the project is bad, you can fully automate <code>git bisect</code>.
First, you again tell it the scope of the bisect by providing the known bad and good commits.
You can do this by listing them with the <code>bisect start</code> command if you want, listing the known bad commit first and the known good commit second:</p>

<h3 id="_git_submodules">Submodules</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It often happens that while working on one project, you need to use another project from within it.
Perhaps it’s a library that a third party developed or that you’re developing separately and using in multiple parent projects.
A common issue arises in these scenarios: you want to be able to treat the two projects as separate yet still be able to use one from within the other.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here’s an example.
Suppose you’re developing a website and creating Atom feeds.
Instead of writing your own Atom-generating code, you decide to use a library.
You’re likely to have to either include this code from a shared library like a CPAN install or Ruby gem, or copy the source code into your own project tree.
The issue with including the library is that it’s difficult to customize the library in any way and often more difficult to deploy it, because you need to make sure every client has that library available.
The issue with copying the code into your own project is that any custom changes you make are difficult to merge when upstream changes become available.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git addresses this issue using submodules.
Submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository.
This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_starting_submodules">Starting with Submodules</h4>

<p>We&#8217;ll walk through developing a simple project that has been split up into a main project and a few sub-projects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s start by adding an existing Git repository as a submodule of the repository that we&#8217;re working on.
To add a new submodule you use the <code>git submodule add</code> command with the absolute or relative URL of the project you would like to start tracking.
In this example, we&#8217;ll add a library called &#8220;DbConnector&#8221;.</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>By default, submodules will add the subproject into a directory named the same as the repository, in this case &#8220;DbConnector&#8221;.
You can add a different path at the end of the command if you want it to go elsewhere.</p>

<p>If you have multiple submodules, you’ll have multiple entries in this file.
It’s important to note that this file is version-controlled with your other files, like your <code>.gitignore</code> file.

You can overwrite this value locally with <code>git config submodule.DbConnector.url PRIVATE_URL</code> for your own use.

<p>The simplest model of using submodules in a project would be if you were simply consuming a subproject and wanted to get updates from it from time to time but were not actually modifying anything in your checkout.
Let&#8217;s walk through a simple example there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to check for new work in a submodule, you can go into the directory and run <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code> the upstream branch to update the local code.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now if you go back into the main project and run <code>git diff --submodule</code> you can see that the submodule was updated and get a list of commits that were added to it.
If you don&#8217;t want to type <code>--submodule</code> every time you run <code>git diff</code>, you can set it as the default format by setting the <code>diff.submodule</code> config value to &#8220;log&#8221;.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you commit at this point then you will lock the submodule into having the new code when other people update.</p>

You can, however, set this to something different if you want.
For example, if you want to have the DbConnector submodule track that repository&#8217;s &#8220;stable&#8221; branch, you can set it in either your <code>.gitmodules</code> file (so everyone else also tracks it), or just in your local <code>.git/config</code> file.
Let&#8217;s set it in the <code>.gitmodules</code> file:</p>

<p>Git will by default try to update <strong>all</strong> of your submodules when you run <code>git submodule update --remote</code> so if you have a lot of them, you may want to pass the name of just the submodule you want to try to update.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_working_on_a_submodule">Working on a Submodule</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s quite likely that if you&#8217;re using submodules, you&#8217;re doing so because you really want to work on the code in the submodule at the same time as you&#8217;re working on the code in the main project (or across several submodules).
Otherwise you would probably instead be using a simpler dependency management system (such as Maven or Rubygems).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So now let&#8217;s go through an example of making changes to the submodule at the same time as the main project and committing and publishing those changes at the same time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, when we&#8217;ve run the <code>git submodule update</code> command to fetch changes from the submodule repositories, Git would get the changes and update the files in the subdirectory but will leave the sub-repository in what&#8217;s called a &#8220;detached HEAD&#8221; state.
This means that there is no local working branch (like &#8220;master&#8221;, for example) tracking changes.
With no working branch tracking changes, that means even if you commit changes to the submodule, those changes will quite possibly be lost the next time you run <code>git submodule update</code>.
You have to do some extra steps if you want changes in a submodule to be tracked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to set up your submodule to be easier to go in and hack on, you need do two things.
You need to go into each submodule and check out a branch to work on.
Then you need to tell Git what to do if you have made changes and then <code>git submodule update --remote</code> pulls in new work from upstream.
The options are that you can merge them into your local work, or you can try to rebase your local work on top of the new changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First of all, let&#8217;s go into our submodule directory and check out a branch.</p>

To specify it manually, we can just add the <code>--merge</code> option to our <code>update</code> call.
Here we&#8217;ll see that there was a change on the server for this submodule and it gets merged in.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to make sure this doesn&#8217;t happen, you can ask Git to check that all your submodules have been pushed properly before pushing the main project.
The <code>git push</code> command takes the <code>--recurse-submodules</code> argument which can be set to either &#8220;check&#8221; or &#8220;on-demand&#8221;.
The &#8220;check&#8221; option will make <code>push</code> simply fail if any of the committed submodule changes haven&#8217;t been pushed.</p>

<p>As you can see, it also gives us some helpful advice on what we might want to do next.
The simple option is to go into each submodule and manually push to the remotes to make sure they&#8217;re externally available and then try this push again.
If you want the check behavior to happen for all pushes, you can make this behavior the default by doing <code>git config push.recurseSubmodules check</code>.</p>

CONFLICT (submodule): Merge conflict in DbConnector
Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So basically what has happened here is that Git has figured out that the two branches record points in the submodule&#8217;s history that are divergent and need to be merged.
It explains it as &#8220;merge following commits not found&#8221;, which is confusing but we&#8217;ll explain why that is in a bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To solve the problem, you need to figure out what state the submodule should be in.
Strangely, Git doesn&#8217;t really give you much information to help out here, not even the SHA-1s of the commits of both sides of the history.
Fortunately, it&#8217;s simple to figure out.
If you run <code>git diff</code> you can get the SHA-1s of the commits recorded in both branches you were trying to merge.</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git diff

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, in this case, <code>eb41d76</code> is the commit in our submodule that <strong>we</strong> had and <code>c771610</code> is the commit that upstream had.
If we go into our submodule directory, it should already be on <code>eb41d76</code> as the merge would not have touched it.
If for whatever reason it&#8217;s not, you can simply create and checkout a branch pointing to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>What is important is the SHA-1 of the commit from the other side.
This is what you&#8217;ll have to merge in and resolve.
You can either just try the merge with the SHA-1 directly, or you can create a branch for it and then try to merge that in.
We would suggest the latter, even if only to make a nicer merge commit message.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So, we will go into our submodule directory, create a branch based on that second SHA-1 from <code>git diff</code> and manually merge.</p>

<p>Interestingly, there is another case that Git handles.
If a merge commit exists in the submodule directory that contains <strong>both</strong> commits in its history, Git will suggest it to you as a possible solution.
It sees that at some point in the submodule project, someone merged branches containing these two commits, so maybe you&#8217;ll want that one.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, not really very difficult, but it can be a little confusing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other main caveat that many people run into involves switching from subdirectories to submodules.
If you’ve been tracking files in your project and you want to move them out into a submodule, you must be careful or Git will get angry at you.
Assume that you have files in a subdirectory of your project, and you want to switch it to a submodule.
If you delete the subdirectory and then run <code>submodule add</code>, Git yells at you:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ rm -Rf CryptoLibrary/
$ git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/CryptoLibrary
'CryptoLibrary' already exists in the index</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have to unstage the <code>CryptoLibrary</code> directory first.
Then you can add the submodule:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git rm -r CryptoLibrary
$ git submodule add https://github.com/chaconinc/CryptoLibrary

Checking connectivity... done.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now suppose you did that in a branch.
If you try to switch back to a branch where those files are still in the actual tree rather than a submodule – you get this error:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout master
error: The following untracked working tree files would be overwritten by checkout:

Aborting</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can force it to switch with <code>checkout -f</code>, but be careful that you don&#8217;t have unsaved changes in there as they could be overwritten with that command.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git checkout -f master
warning: unable to rmdir CryptoLibrary: Directory not empty
Switched to branch 'master'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, when you switch back, you get an empty <code>CryptoLibrary</code> directory for some reason and <code>git submodule update</code> may not fix it either.
You may need to go into your submodule directory and run a <code>git checkout .</code> to get all your files back.
You could run this in a <code>submodule foreach</code> script to run it for multiple submodules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that submodules these days keep all their Git data in the top project&#8217;s <code>.git</code> directory, so unlike much older versions of Git, destroying a submodule directory won&#8217;t lose any commits or branches that you had.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With these tools, submodules can be a fairly simple and effective method for developing on several related but still separate projects simultaneously.</p>
</div>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_bundling">Bundling</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though we&#8217;ve covered the common ways to transfer Git data over a network (HTTP, SSH, etc), there is actually one more way to do so that is not commonly used but can actually be quite useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git is capable of &#8220;bundling&#8221; its data into a single file.
This can be useful in various scenarios.
Maybe your network is down and you want to send changes to your co-workers.
Perhaps you&#8217;re working somewhere offsite and don&#8217;t have access to the local network for security reasons.
Maybe your wireless/ethernet card just broke.
Maybe you don&#8217;t have access to a shared server for the moment, you want to email someone updates and you don&#8217;t want to transfer 40 commits via <code>format-patch</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is where the <code>git bundle</code> command can be helpful.
The <code>bundle</code> command will package up everything that would normally be pushed over the wire with a <code>git push</code> command into a binary file that you can email to someone or put on a flash drive, then unbundle into another repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s see a simple example.
Let&#8217;s say you have a repository with two commits:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to send that repository to someone and you don&#8217;t have access to a repository to push to, or simply don&#8217;t want to set one up, you can bundle it with <code>git bundle create</code>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you have a file named <code>repo.bundle</code> that has all the data needed to re-create the repository&#8217;s <code>master</code> branch.
With the <code>bundle</code> command you need to list out every reference or specific range of commits that you want to be included.
If you intend for this to be cloned somewhere else, you should add HEAD as a reference as well as we&#8217;ve done here.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can email this <code>repo.bundle</code> file to someone else, or put it on a USB drive and walk it over.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the other side, say you are sent this <code>repo.bundle</code> file and want to work on the project.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you don&#8217;t include HEAD in the references, you have to also specify <code>-b master</code> or whatever branch is included because otherwise it won&#8217;t know what branch to check out.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s say you do three commits on it and want to send the new commits back via a bundle on a USB stick or email.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First we need to determine the range of commits we want to include in the bundle.
Unlike the network protocols which figure out the minimum set of data to transfer over the network for us, we&#8217;ll have to figure this out manually.
 Now, you could just do the same thing and bundle the entire repository, which will work, but it&#8217;s better to just bundle up the difference - just the three commits we just made locally.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to do that, you&#8217;ll have to calculate the difference.
As we described in <a href="#_commit_ranges">Commit Ranges</a>, you can specify a range of commits in a number of ways.
To get the three commits that we have in our master branch that weren&#8217;t in the branch we originally cloned, we can use something like <code>origin/master..master</code> or <code>master ^origin/master</code>.
You can test that with the <code>log</code> command.</p>

<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log --oneline master ^origin/master

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So now that we have the list of commits we want to include in the bundle, let&#8217;s bundle them up.
We do that with the <code>git bundle create</code> command, giving it a filename we want our bundle to be and the range of commits we want to go into it.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git bundle create commits.bundle master ^9a466c5

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we have a <code>commits.bundle</code> file in our directory.
If we take that and send it to our partner, she can then import it into the original repository, even if more work has been done there in the meantime.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When she gets the bundle, she can inspect it to see what it contains before she imports it into her repository.
The first command is the <code>bundle verify</code> command that will make sure the file is actually a valid Git bundle and that you have all the necessary ancestors to reconstitute it properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git bundle verify ../commits.bundle

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the bundler had created a bundle of just the last two commits they had done, rather than all three, the original repository would not be able to import it, since it is missing requisite history.
The <code>verify</code> command would have looked like this instead:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git bundle verify ../commits-bad.bundle

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, our first bundle is valid, so we can fetch in commits from it.
If you want to see what branches are in the bundle that can be imported, there is also a command to just list the heads:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git bundle list-heads ../commits.bundle

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>verify</code> sub-command will tell you the heads as well.
The point is to see what can be pulled in, so you can use the <code>fetch</code> or <code>pull</code> commands to import commits from this bundle.
Here we&#8217;ll fetch the <em>master</em> branch of the bundle to a branch named <em>other-master</em> in our repository:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git fetch ../commits.bundle master:other-master

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we can see that we have the imported commits on the <em>other-master</em> branch as well as any commits we&#8217;ve done in the meantime in our own <em>master</em> branch.</p>

<p>So, <code>git bundle</code> can be really useful for sharing or doing network-type operations when you don&#8217;t have the proper network or shared repository to do so.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_replace">Replace</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git&#8217;s objects are unchangeable, but it does provide an interesting way to pretend to replace objects in its database with other objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>replace</code> command lets you specify an object in Git and say "every time you see this, pretend it&#8217;s this other thing".
This is most commonly useful for replacing one commit in your history with another one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, let&#8217;s say you have a huge code history and want to split your repository into one short history for new developers and one much longer and larger history for people interested in data mining.
You can graft one history onto the other by `replace`ing the earliest commit in the new line with the latest commit on the older one.
This is nice because it means that you don&#8217;t actually have to rewrite every commit in the new history, as you would normally have to do to join them together (because the parentage affects the SHA-1s).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s try this out.
Let&#8217;s take an existing repository, split it into two repositories, one recent and one historical, and then we&#8217;ll see how we can recombine them without modifying the recent repositories SHA-1 values via <code>replace</code>.</p>

</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_credential_caching">Credential Storage</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

If you use the SSH transport for connecting to remotes, it&#8217;s possible for you to have a key without a passphrase, which allows you to securely transfer data without typing in your username and password.
However, this isn&#8217;t possible with the HTTP protocols – every connection needs a username and password.
This gets even harder for systems with two-factor authentication, where the token you use for a password is randomly generated and unpronounceable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Fortunately, Git has a credentials system that can help with this.
Git has a few options provided in the box:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The default is not to cache at all.
Every connection will prompt you for your username and password.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &#8220;cache&#8221; mode keeps credentials in memory for a certain period of time.
None of the passwords are ever stored on disk, and they are purged from the cache after 15 minutes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The &#8220;store&#8221; mode saves the credentials to a plain-text file on disk, and they never expire.
This means that until you change your password for the Git host, you won&#8217;t ever have to type in your credentials again.
The downside of this approach is that your passwords are stored in cleartext in a plain file in your home directory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you&#8217;re using a Mac, Git comes with an &#8220;osxkeychain&#8221; mode, which caches credentials in the secure keychain that&#8217;s attached to your system account.
This method stores the credentials on disk, and they never expire, but they&#8217;re encrypted with the same system that stores HTTPS certificates and Safari auto-fills.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If you&#8217;re using Windows, you can install a helper called &#8220;Git Credential Manager for Windows.&#8221;
This is similar to the &#8220;osxkeychain&#8221; helper described above, but uses the Windows Credential Store to control sensitive information.
It can be found at <a href="https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows" class="bare">https://github.com/Microsoft/Git-Credential-Manager-for-Windows</a>.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can choose one of these methods by setting a Git configuration value:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global credential.helper cache</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some of these helpers have options.
The &#8220;store&#8221; helper can take a <code>--file &lt;path&gt;</code> argument, which customizes where the plain-text file is saved (the default is <code>~/.git-credentials</code>).
The &#8220;cache&#8221; helper accepts the <code>--timeout &lt;seconds&gt;</code> option, which changes the amount of time its daemon is kept running (the default is &#8220;900&#8221;, or 15 minutes).
Here&#8217;s an example of how you&#8217;d configure the &#8220;store&#8221; helper with a custom file name:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global credential.helper 'store --file ~/.my-credentials'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git even allows you to configure several helpers.
When looking for credentials for a particular host, Git will query them in order, and stop after the first answer is provided.
When saving credentials, Git will send the username and password to <strong>all</strong> of the helpers in the list, and they can choose what to do with them.
Here&#8217;s what a <code>.gitconfig</code> would look like if you had a credentials file on a thumb drive, but wanted to use the in-memory cache to save some typing if the drive isn&#8217;t plugged in:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[credential]
    helper = store --file /mnt/thumbdrive/.git-credentials
    helper = cache --timeout 30000</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_under_the_hood">Under the Hood</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How does this all work?
Git&#8217;s root command for the credential-helper system is <code>git credential</code>, which takes a command as an argument, and then more input through stdin.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This might be easier to understand with an example.
Let&#8217;s say that a credential helper has been configured, and the helper has stored credentials for <code>mygithost</code>.
Here&#8217;s a session that uses the &#8220;fill&#8221; command, which is invoked when Git is trying to find credentials for a host:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git credential fill <b class="conum">(1)</b>
protocol=https <b class="conum">(2)</b>

<b class="conum">(3)</b>
protocol=https <b class="conum">(4)</b>
host=mygithost
username=bob
password=s3cre7
$ git credential fill <b class="conum">(5)</b>
protocol=https
host=unknownhost

Username for 'https://unknownhost': bob
Password for 'https://bob@unknownhost':
protocol=https
host=unknownhost
username=bob
password=s3cre7</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="colist arabic">
<ol>
<li>
<p>This is the command line that initiates the interaction.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git-credential is then waiting for input on stdin.
We provide it with the things we know: the protocol and hostname.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>A blank line indicates that the input is complete, and the credential system should answer with what it knows.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Git-credential then takes over, and writes to stdout with the bits of information it found.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If credentials are not found, Git asks the user for the username and password, and provides them back to the invoking stdout (here they&#8217;re attached to the same console).</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The credential system is actually invoking a program that&#8217;s separate from Git itself; which one and how depends on the <code>credential.helper</code> configuration value.
There are several forms it can take:</p>
</div>
<table class="tableblock frame-all grid-all spread">
<colgroup>
<col style="width: 50%;">
<col style="width: 50%;">

</table>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So the helpers described above are actually named <code>git-credential-cache</code>, <code>git-credential-store</code>, and so on, and we can configure them to take command-line arguments.
The general form for this is &#8220;git-credential-foo [args] &lt;action&gt;.&#8221;
The stdin/stdout protocol is the same as git-credential, but they use a slightly different set of actions:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><code>get</code> is a request for a username/password pair.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>store</code> is a request to save a set of credentials in this helper&#8217;s memory.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>erase</code> purge the credentials for the given properties from this helper&#8217;s memory.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the <code>store</code> and <code>erase</code> actions, no response is required (Git ignores it anyway).
For the <code>get</code> action, however, Git is very interested in what the helper has to say.
If the helper doesn&#8217;t know anything useful, it can simply exit with no output, but if it does know, it should augment the provided information with the information it has stored.
The output is treated like a series of assignment statements; anything provided will replace what Git already knows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s the same example from above, but skipping git-credential and going straight for git-credential-store:</p>

</li>
<li>
<p>Now we&#8217;ll retrieve those credentials.
We provide the parts of the connection we already know (<code>https://mygithost</code>), and an empty line.</p>
</li>
<li>

<p>It&#8217;s just a series of lines, each of which contains a credential-decorated URL.
The <code>osxkeychain</code> and <code>wincred</code> helpers use the native format of their backing stores, while <code>cache</code> uses its own in-memory format (which no other process can read).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_a_custom_credential_cache">A Custom Credential Cache</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Given that <code>git-credential-store</code> and friends are separate programs from Git, it&#8217;s not much of a leap to realize that <em>any</em> program can be a Git credential helper.
The helpers provided by Git cover many common use cases, but not all.
For example, let&#8217;s say your team has some credentials that are shared with the entire team, perhaps for deployment.
These are stored in a shared directory, but you don&#8217;t want to copy them to your own credential store, because they change often.
None of the existing helpers cover this case; let&#8217;s see what it would take to write our own.
There are several key features this program needs to have:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>The only action we need to pay attention to is <code>get</code>; <code>store</code> and <code>erase</code> are write operations, so we&#8217;ll just exit cleanly when they&#8217;re received.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The file format of the shared-credential file is the same as that used by <code>git-credential-store</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The location of that file is fairly standard, but we should allow the user to pass a custom path just in case.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once again, we&#8217;ll write this extension in Ruby, but any language will work so long as Git can execute the finished product.
Here&#8217;s the full source code of our new credential helper:</p>

<p>You’ve seen a number of advanced tools that allow you to manipulate your commits and staging area more precisely.
When you notice issues, you should be able to easily figure out what commit introduced them, when, and by whom.
If you want to use subprojects in your project, you’ve learned how to accommodate those needs.
At this point, you should be able to do most of the things in Git that you’ll need on the command line day to day and feel comfortable doing so.</p>

<h2 id="_customizing_git">Customizing Git</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So far, we&#8217;ve covered the basics of how Git works and how to use it, and we&#8217;ve introduced a number of tools that Git provides to help you use it easily and efficiently.
In this chapter, we&#8217;ll see how you can make Git operate in a more customized fashion, by introducing several important configuration settings and the hooks system.
With these tools, it&#8217;s easy to get Git to work exactly the way you, your company, or your group needs it to.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_git_config">Git Configuration</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
As you briefly saw in <a href="#_getting_started">Getting Started</a>, you can specify Git configuration settings with the <code>git config</code> command.
One of the first things you did was set up your name and email address:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global user.name "John Doe"
$ git config --global user.email johndoe@example.com</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you&#8217;ll learn a few of the more interesting options that you can set in this manner to customize your Git usage.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, a quick review: Git uses a series of configuration files to determine non-default behavior that you may want.
The first place Git looks for these values is in an <code>/etc/gitconfig</code> file, which contains values for every user on the system and all of their repositories.
If you pass the option <code>--system</code> to <code>git config</code>, it reads and writes from this file specifically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next place Git looks is the <code>~/.gitconfig</code> (or <code>~/.config/git/config</code>) file, which is specific to each user.
You can make Git read and write to this file by passing the <code>--global</code> option.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, Git looks for configuration values in the configuration file in the Git directory (<code>.git/config</code>) of whatever repository you&#8217;re currently using.
These values are specific to that single repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each of these &#8220;levels&#8221; (system, global, local) overwrites values in the previous level, so values in <code>.git/config</code> trump those in <code>/etc/gitconfig</code>, for instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git&#8217;s configuration files are plain-text, so you can also set these values by manually editing the file and inserting the correct syntax.
It&#8217;s generally easier to run the <code>git config</code> command, though.</p>
</div>
</td>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_basic_client_configuration">Basic Client Configuration</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The configuration options recognized by Git fall into two categories: client-side and server-side.
The majority of the options are client-side – configuring your personal working preferences.
Many, <em>many</em> configuration options are supported, but a large fraction of them are only useful in certain edge cases.
We&#8217;ll only be covering the most common and most useful here.
If you want to see a list of all the options your version of Git recognizes, you can run</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ man git-config</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command lists all the available options in quite a bit of detail.
You can also find this reference material at <a href="http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config.html" class="bare">http://git-scm.com/docs/git-config.html</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_core_editor_code"><code>core.editor</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
By default, Git uses whatever you&#8217;ve set as your default text editor (<code>$VISUAL</code> or <code>$EDITOR</code>) or else falls back to the <code>vi</code> editor to create and edit your commit and tag messages.
To change that default to something else, you can use the <code>core.editor</code> setting:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global core.editor emacs</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, no matter what is set as your default shell editor, Git will fire up Emacs to edit messages.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_commit_template_code"><code>commit.template</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If you set this to the path of a file on your system, Git will use that file as the default message when you commit.
For instance, suppose you create a template file at <code>~/.gitmessage.txt</code> that looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">subject line

what happened

[ticket: X]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To tell Git to use it as the default message that appears in your editor when you run <code>git commit</code>, set the <code>commit.template</code> configuration value:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global commit.template ~/.gitmessage.txt
$ git commit</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, your editor will open to something like this for your placeholder commit message when you commit:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">subject line

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your team has a commit-message policy, then putting a template for that policy on your system and configuring Git to use it by default can help increase the chance of that policy being followed regularly.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_core_pager_code"><code>core.pager</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
This setting determines which pager is used when Git pages output such as <code>log</code> and <code>diff</code>.
You can set it to <code>more</code> or to your favorite pager (by default, it&#8217;s <code>less</code>), or you can turn it off by setting it to a blank string:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global core.pager ''</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you run that, Git will page the entire output of all commands, no matter how long they are.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_user_signingkey_code"><code>user.signingkey</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If you&#8217;re making signed annotated tags (as discussed in <a href="#_signing">Signing Your Work</a>), setting your GPG signing key as a configuration setting makes things easier.
Set your key ID like so:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global user.signingkey &lt;gpg-key-id&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, you can sign tags without having to specify your key every time with the <code>git tag</code> command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git tag -s &lt;tag-name&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_core_excludesfile_code"><code>core.excludesfile</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
You can put patterns in your project&#8217;s <code>.gitignore</code> file to have Git not see them as untracked files or try to stage them when you run <code>git add</code> on them, as discussed in <a href="#_ignoring">Ignoring Files</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But sometimes you want to ignore certain files for all repositories that you work with.
If your computer is running Mac OS X, you&#8217;re probably familiar with <code>.DS_Store</code> files.
If your preferred editor is Emacs or Vim, you know about filenames that end with a <code>~</code> or <code>.swp</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This setting lets you write a kind of global <code>.gitignore</code> file.
If you create a <code>~/.gitignore_global</code> file with these contents:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">*~
.*.swp
.DS_Store</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>…and you run <code>git config --global core.excludesfile ~/.gitignore_global</code>, Git will never again bother you about those files.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_help_autocorrect_code"><code>help.autocorrect</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If you mistype a command, it shows you something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git chekcout master
git: 'chekcout' is not a git command. See 'git --help'.

Did you mean this?
    checkout</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git helpfully tries to figure out what you meant, but it still refuses to do it.
If you set <code>help.autocorrect</code> to 1, Git will actually run this command for you:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git chekcout master
WARNING: You called a Git command named 'chekcout', which does not exist.
Continuing under the assumption that you meant 'checkout'
in 0.1 seconds automatically...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note that &#8220;0.1 seconds&#8221; business. <code>help.autocorrect</code> is actually an integer which represents tenths of a second.
So if you set it to 50, Git will give you 5 seconds to change your mind before executing the autocorrected command.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_colors_in_git">Colors in Git</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Git fully supports colored terminal output, which greatly aids in visually parsing command output quickly and easily.
A number of options can help you set the coloring to your preference.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_color_ui_code"><code>color.ui</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git automatically colors most of its output, but there&#8217;s a master switch if you don&#8217;t like this behavior.
To turn off all Git&#8217;s colored terminal output, do this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global color.ui false</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The default setting is <code>auto</code>, which colors output when it&#8217;s going straight to a terminal, but omits the color-control codes when the output is redirected to a pipe or a file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also set it to <code>always</code> to ignore the difference between terminals and pipes.
You&#8217;ll rarely want this; in most scenarios, if you want color codes in your redirected output, you can instead pass a <code>--color</code> flag to the Git command to force it to use color codes.
The default setting is almost always what you&#8217;ll want.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_color_code"><code>color.*</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to be more specific about which commands are colored and how, Git provides verb-specific coloring settings.
Each of these can be set to <code>true</code>, <code>false</code>, or <code>always</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="literalblock">
<div class="content">
<pre>color.branch
color.diff
color.interactive
color.status</pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition, each of these has subsettings you can use to set specific colors for parts of the output, if you want to override each color.
For example, to set the meta information in your diff output to blue foreground, black background, and bold text, you can run</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global color.diff.meta "blue black bold"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can set the color to any of the following values: <code>normal</code>, <code>black</code>, <code>red</code>, <code>green</code>, <code>yellow</code>, <code>blue</code>, <code>magenta</code>, <code>cyan</code>, or <code>white</code>.
If you want an attribute like bold in the previous example, you can choose from <code>bold</code>, <code>dim</code>, <code>ul</code> (underline), <code>blink</code>, and <code>reverse</code> (swap foreground and background).</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_external_merge_tools">External Merge and Diff Tools</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Although Git has an internal implementation of diff, which is what we&#8217;ve been showing in this book, you can set up an external tool instead.
You can also set up a graphical merge-conflict-resolution tool instead of having to resolve conflicts manually.
We&#8217;ll demonstrate setting up the Perforce Visual Merge Tool (P4Merge) to do your diffs and merge resolutions, because it&#8217;s a nice graphical tool and it&#8217;s free.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to try this out, P4Merge works on all major platforms, so you should be able to do so.
We&#8217;ll use path names in the examples that work on Mac and Linux systems; for Windows, you&#8217;ll have to change <code>/usr/local/bin</code> to an executable path in your environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To begin, <a href="https://www.perforce.com/product/components/perforce-visual-merge-and-diff-tools">download P4Merge from Perforce</a>.
Next, you&#8217;ll set up external wrapper scripts to run your commands.
We&#8217;ll use the Mac path for the executable; in other systems, it will be where your <code>p4merge</code> binary is installed.
Set up a merge wrapper script named <code>extMerge</code> that calls your binary with all the arguments provided:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat /usr/local/bin/extMerge
#!/bin/sh
/Applications/p4merge.app/Contents/MacOS/p4merge $*</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The diff wrapper checks to make sure seven arguments are provided and passes two of them to your merge script.
By default, Git passes the following arguments to the diff program:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>path old-file old-hex old-mode new-file new-hex new-mode</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because you only want the <code>old-file</code> and <code>new-file</code> arguments, you use the wrapper script to pass the ones you need.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat /usr/local/bin/extDiff
#!/bin/sh
[ $# -eq 7 ] &amp;&amp; /usr/local/bin/extMerge "$2" "$5"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also need to make sure these tools are executable:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/extMerge
$ sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/extDiff</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you can set up your config file to use your custom merge resolution and diff tools.
This takes a number of custom settings: <code>merge.tool</code> to tell Git what strategy to use, <code>mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.cmd</code> to specify how to run the command, <code>mergetool.&lt;tool&gt;.trustExitCode</code> to tell Git if the exit code of that program indicates a successful merge resolution or not, and <code>diff.external</code> to tell Git what command to run for diffs.
So, you can either run four config commands</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global merge.tool extMerge
$ git config --global mergetool.extMerge.cmd \
  'extMerge "$BASE" "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE" "$MERGED"'
$ git config --global mergetool.extMerge.trustExitCode false
$ git config --global diff.external extDiff</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>or you can edit your <code>~/.gitconfig</code> file to add these lines:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[merge]
  tool = extMerge
[mergetool "extMerge"]
  cmd = extMerge "$BASE" "$LOCAL" "$REMOTE" "$MERGED"
  trustExitCode = false
[diff]
  external = extDiff</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After all this is set, if you run diff commands such as this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git diff 32d1776b1^ 32d1776b1</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of getting the diff output on the command line, Git fires up P4Merge, which looks something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/p4merge.png" alt="P4Merge.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 143. P4Merge.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you try to merge two branches and subsequently have merge conflicts, you can run the command <code>git mergetool</code>; it starts P4Merge to let you resolve the conflicts through that GUI tool.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The nice thing about this wrapper setup is that you can change your diff and merge tools easily.
For example, to change your <code>extDiff</code> and <code>extMerge</code> tools to run the KDiff3 tool instead, all you have to do is edit your <code>extMerge</code> file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat /usr/local/bin/extMerge
#!/bin/sh
/Applications/kdiff3.app/Contents/MacOS/kdiff3 $*</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, Git will use the KDiff3 tool for diff viewing and merge conflict resolution.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git comes preset to use a number of other merge-resolution tools without your having to set up the cmd configuration.
To see a list of the tools it supports, try this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git mergetool --tool-help
'git mergetool --tool=&lt;tool&gt;' may be set to one of the following:

        gvimdiff
        gvimdiff2
        opendiff
        p4merge
        vimdiff
        vimdiff2

The following tools are valid, but not currently available:
        araxis
        bc3
        codecompare
        deltawalker
        diffmerge
        diffuse
        ecmerge
        kdiff3
        meld
        tkdiff
        tortoisemerge
        xxdiff

Some of the tools listed above only work in a windowed
environment. If run in a terminal-only session, they will fail.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re not interested in using KDiff3 for diff but rather want to use it just for merge resolution, and the kdiff3 command is in your path, then you can run</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global merge.tool kdiff3</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you run this instead of setting up the <code>extMerge</code> and <code>extDiff</code> files, Git will use KDiff3 for merge resolution and the normal Git diff tool for diffs.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_formatting_and_whitespace">Formatting and Whitespace</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Formatting and whitespace issues are some of the more frustrating and subtle problems that many developers encounter when collaborating, especially cross-platform.
It&#8217;s very easy for patches or other collaborated work to introduce subtle whitespace changes because editors silently introduce them, and if your files ever touch a Windows system, their line endings might be replaced.
Git has a few configuration options to help with these issues.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_core_autocrlf_code"><code>core.autocrlf</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If you&#8217;re programming on Windows and working with people who are not (or vice-versa), you&#8217;ll probably run into line-ending issues at some point.
This is because Windows uses both a carriage-return character and a linefeed character for newlines in its files, whereas Mac and Linux systems use only the linefeed character.
This is a subtle but incredibly annoying fact of cross-platform work; many editors on Windows silently replace existing LF-style line endings with CRLF, or insert both line-ending characters when the user hits the enter key.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git can handle this by auto-converting CRLF line endings into LF when you add a file to the index, and vice versa when it checks out code onto your filesystem.
You can turn on this functionality with the <code>core.autocrlf</code> setting.
If you&#8217;re on a Windows machine, set it to <code>true</code> – this converts LF endings into CRLF when you check out code:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global core.autocrlf true</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re on a Linux or Mac system that uses LF line endings, then you don&#8217;t want Git to automatically convert them when you check out files; however, if a file with CRLF endings accidentally gets introduced, then you may want Git to fix it.
You can tell Git to convert CRLF to LF on commit but not the other way around by setting <code>core.autocrlf</code> to input:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global core.autocrlf input</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This setup should leave you with CRLF endings in Windows checkouts, but LF endings on Mac and Linux systems and in the repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re a Windows programmer doing a Windows-only project, then you can turn off this functionality, recording the carriage returns in the repository by setting the config value to <code>false</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global core.autocrlf false</code></pre>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_core_whitespace_code"><code>core.whitespace</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git comes preset to detect and fix some whitespace issues.
It can look for six primary whitespace issues – three are enabled by default and can be turned off, and three are disabled by default but can be activated.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The three that are turned on by default are <code>blank-at-eol</code>, which looks for spaces at the end of a line; <code>blank-at-eof</code>, which notices blank lines at the end of a file; and <code>space-before-tab</code>, which looks for spaces before tabs at the beginning of a line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The three that are disabled by default but can be turned on are <code>indent-with-non-tab</code>, which looks for lines that begin with spaces instead of tabs (and is controlled by the <code>tabwidth</code> option); <code>tab-in-indent</code>, which watches for tabs in the indentation portion of a line; and <code>cr-at-eol</code>, which tells Git that carriage returns at the end of lines are OK.</p>

<p>Not nearly as many configuration options are available for the server side of Git, but there are a few interesting ones you may want to take note of.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_receive_fsckobjects_code"><code>receive.fsckObjects</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git is capable of making sure every object received during a push still matches its SHA-1 checksum and points to valid objects.
However, it doesn&#8217;t do this by default; it&#8217;s a fairly expensive operation, and might slow down the operation, especially on large repositories or pushes.
If you want Git to check object consistency on every push, you can force it to do so by setting <code>receive.fsckObjects</code> to true:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --system receive.fsckObjects true</code></pre>

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_receive_denynonfastforwards_code"><code>receive.denyNonFastForwards</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you rebase commits that you&#8217;ve already pushed and then try to push again, or otherwise try to push a commit to a remote branch that doesn&#8217;t contain the commit that the remote branch currently points to, you&#8217;ll be denied.
This is generally good policy; but in the case of the rebase, you may determine that you know what you&#8217;re doing and can force-update the remote branch with a <code>-f</code> flag to your push command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To tell Git to refuse force-pushes, set <code>receive.denyNonFastForwards</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --system receive.denyNonFastForwards true</code></pre>

<p>The other way you can do this is via server-side receive hooks, which we&#8217;ll cover in a bit.
That approach lets you do more complex things like deny non-fast-forwards to a certain subset of users.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_receive_denydeletes_code"><code>receive.denyDeletes</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One of the workarounds to the <code>denyNonFastForwards</code> policy is for the user to delete the branch and then push it back up with the new reference.
To avoid this, set <code>receive.denyDeletes</code> to true:</p>

Some of these settings can also be specified for a path, so that Git applies those settings only for a subdirectory or subset of files.
These path-specific settings are called Git attributes and are set either in a <code>.gitattributes</code> file in one of your directories (normally the root of your project) or in the <code>.git/info/attributes</code> file if you don&#8217;t want the attributes file committed with your project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Using attributes, you can do things like specify separate merge strategies for individual files or directories in your project, tell Git how to diff non-text files, or have Git filter content before you check it into or out of Git.

One cool trick for which you can use Git attributes is telling Git which files are binary (in cases it otherwise may not be able to figure out) and giving Git special instructions about how to handle those files.
For instance, some text files may be machine generated and not diffable, whereas some binary files can be diffed.
You&#8217;ll see how to tell Git which is which.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_identifying_binary_files">Identifying Binary Files</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some files look like text files but for all intents and purposes are to be treated as binary data.
For instance, Xcode projects on the Mac contain a file that ends in <code>.pbxproj</code>, which is basically a JSON (plain-text JavaScript data format) dataset written out to disk by the IDE, which records your build settings and so on.
Although it&#8217;s technically a text file (because it&#8217;s all UTF-8), you don&#8217;t want to treat it as such because it&#8217;s really a lightweight database – you can&#8217;t merge the contents if two people change it, and diffs generally aren&#8217;t helpful.
The file is meant to be consumed by a machine.
In essence, you want to treat it like a binary file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To tell Git to treat all <code>pbxproj</code> files as binary data, add the following line to your <code>.gitattributes</code> file:</p>

<p>Now, Git won&#8217;t try to convert or fix CRLF issues; nor will it try to compute or print a diff for changes in this file when you run <code>git show</code> or <code>git diff</code> on your project.</p>

</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_diffing_binary_files">Diffing Binary Files</h5>

<p>First, you&#8217;ll use this technique to solve one of the most annoying problems known to humanity: version-controlling Microsoft Word documents.
Everyone knows that Word is the most horrific editor around, but oddly, everyone still uses it.
If you want to version-control Word documents, you can stick them in a Git repository and commit every once in a while; but what good does that do?
If you run <code>git diff</code> normally, you only see something like this:</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can&#8217;t directly compare two versions unless you check them out and scan them manually, right?
It turns out you can do this fairly well using Git attributes.
Put the following line in your <code>.gitattributes</code> file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">*.docx diff=word</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This tells Git that any file that matches this pattern (<code>.docx</code>) should use the &#8220;word&#8221; filter when you try to view a diff that contains changes.
What is the &#8220;word&#8221; filter?
You have to set it up.
Here you&#8217;ll configure Git to use the <code>docx2txt</code> program to convert Word documents into readable text files, which it will then diff properly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, you&#8217;ll need to install <code>docx2txt</code>; you can download it from <a href="http://docx2txt.sourceforge.net" class="bare">http://docx2txt.sourceforge.net</a>.
Follow the instructions in the <code>INSTALL</code> file to put it somewhere your shell can find it.
Next, you&#8217;ll write a wrapper script to convert output to the format Git expects.
Create a file that&#8217;s somewhere in your path called <code>docx2txt</code>, and add these contents:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">#!/bin/bash
docx2txt.pl "$1" -</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don&#8217;t forget to <code>chmod a+x</code> that file.

</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config diff.word.textconv docx2txt</code></pre>

<p>Now Git knows that if it tries to do a diff between two snapshots, and any of the files end in <code>.docx</code>, it should run those files through the &#8220;word&#8221; filter, which is defined as the <code>docx2txt</code> program.
This effectively makes nice text-based versions of your Word files before attempting to diff them.</p>

 This chapter will be about getting started with Git. We will begin at the beginning by explaining some background on version control tools, then move on to how to get Git running on your system and finally how to get it setup to start working with. At the end of this chapter you should understand why Git is around, why you should use it and you should be all setup to do so.
 1.1. About Version Control
 What is "version control", and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. For the examples in this book you will use software source code as the files being version controlled, though in reality you can do this with nearly any type of file on a computer.
+Testing: 1, 2, 3.
 If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.
 1.1.1. Local Version Control Systems
 Many people's version-control method of choice is to copy files into another directory (perhaps a time-stamped directory, if they're clever). This approach is very common because it is so simple, but it is also incredibly error prone. It is easy to forget which directory you're in and accidentally write to the wrong file or copy over files you don't mean to.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git successfully and succinctly tells us that we added the string &#8220;Testing: 1, 2, 3.&#8221;, which is correct.
It&#8217;s not perfect – formatting changes wouldn&#8217;t show up here – but it certainly works.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another interesting problem you can solve this way involves diffing image files.
One way to do this is to run image files through a filter that extracts their EXIF information – metadata that is recorded with most image formats.
If you download and install the <code>exiftool</code> program, you can use it to convert your images into text about the metadata, so at least the diff will show you a textual representation of any changes that happened.
Put the following line in your <code>.gitattributes</code> file:</p>

<h4 id="_keyword_expansion">Keyword Expansion</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
SVN- or CVS-style keyword expansion is often requested by developers used to those systems.
The main problem with this in Git is that you can&#8217;t modify a file with information about the commit after you&#8217;ve committed, because Git checksums the file first.
However, you can inject text into a file when it&#8217;s checked out and remove it again before it&#8217;s added to a commit.
Git attributes offers you two ways to do this.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, you can inject the SHA-1 checksum of a blob into an <code>$Id$</code> field in the file automatically.
If you set this attribute on a file or set of files, then the next time you check out that branch, Git will replace that field with the SHA-1 of the blob.
It&#8217;s important to notice that it isn&#8217;t the SHA-1 of the commit, but of the blob itself.
Put the following line in your <code>.gitattributes</code> file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">*.txt ident</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Add an <code>$Id$</code> reference to a test file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ echo '$Id$' &gt; test.txt</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next time you check out this file, Git injects the SHA-1 of the blob:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ rm test.txt
$ git checkout -- test.txt
$ cat test.txt
$Id: 42812b7653c7b88933f8a9d6cad0ca16714b9bb3 $</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, that result is of limited use.
If you&#8217;ve used keyword substitution in CVS or Subversion, you can include a datestamp – the SHA-1 isn&#8217;t all that helpful, because it&#8217;s fairly random and you can&#8217;t tell if one SHA-1 is older or newer than another just by looking at them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It turns out that you can write your own filters for doing substitutions in files on commit/checkout.
These are called &#8220;clean&#8221; and &#8220;smudge&#8221; filters.
In the <code>.gitattributes</code> file, you can set a filter for particular paths and then set up scripts that will process files just before they&#8217;re checked out (&#8220;smudge&#8221;, see <a href="#filters_a">The &#8220;smudge&#8221; filter is run on checkout.</a>) and just before they&#8217;re staged (&#8220;clean&#8221;, see <a href="#filters_b">The &#8220;clean&#8221; filter is run when files are staged.</a>).
These filters can be set to do all sorts of fun things.</p>
</div>
<div id="filters_a" class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/smudge.png" alt="The ``smudge'' filter is run on checkout.">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The original commit message for this feature gives a simple example of running all your C source code through the <code>indent</code> program before committing.
You can set it up by setting the filter attribute in your <code>.gitattributes</code> file to filter <code>*.c</code> files with the &#8220;indent&#8221; filter:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">*.c filter=indent</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, tell Git what the &#8220;indent&#8221; filter does on smudge and clean:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global filter.indent.clean indent
$ git config --global filter.indent.smudge cat</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, when you commit files that match <code>*.c</code>, Git will run them through the indent program before it stages them and then run them through the <code>cat</code> program before it checks them back out onto disk.
The <code>cat</code> program does essentially nothing: it spits out the same data that it comes in.
This combination effectively filters all C source code files through <code>indent</code> before committing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another interesting example gets <code>$Date$</code> keyword expansion, RCS style.
To do this properly, you need a small script that takes a filename, figures out the last commit date for this project, and inserts the date into the file.
Here is a small Ruby script that does that:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">#! /usr/bin/env ruby
data = STDIN.read
last_date = `git log --pretty=format:"%ad" -1`
puts data.gsub('$Date$', '$Date: ' + last_date.to_s + '$')</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the script does is get the latest commit date from the <code>git log</code> command, stick that into any <code>$Date$</code> strings it sees in stdin, and print the results – it should be simple to do in whatever language you&#8217;re most comfortable in.
You can name this file <code>expand_date</code> and put it in your path.
Now, you need to set up a filter in Git (call it <code>dater</code>) and tell it to use your <code>expand_date</code> filter to smudge the files on checkout.
You&#8217;ll use a Perl expression to clean that up on commit:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config filter.dater.smudge expand_date
$ git config filter.dater.clean 'perl -pe "s/\\\$Date[^\\\$]*\\\$/\\\$Date\\\$/"'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This Perl snippet strips out anything it sees in a <code>$Date$</code> string, to get back to where you started.
Now that your filter is ready, you can test it by setting up a Git attribute for that file that engages the new filter and creating a file with your <code>$Date$</code> keyword:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">date*.txt filter=dater</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ echo '# $Date$' &gt; date_test.txt</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you commit those changes and check out the file again, you see the keyword properly substituted:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git add date_test.txt .gitattributes
$ git commit -m "Testing date expansion in Git"
$ rm date_test.txt
$ git checkout date_test.txt
$ cat date_test.txt
# $Date: Tue Apr 21 07:26:52 2009 -0700$</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see how powerful this technique can be for customized applications.
You have to be careful, though, because the <code>.gitattributes</code> file is committed and passed around with the project, but the driver (in this case, <code>dater</code>) isn&#8217;t, so it won&#8217;t work everywhere.
When you design these filters, they should be able to fail gracefully and have the project still work properly.</p>

<h4 id="_merge_strategies">Merge Strategies</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
You can also use Git attributes to tell Git to use different merge strategies for specific files in your project.
One very useful option is to tell Git to not try to merge specific files when they have conflicts, but rather to use your side of the merge over someone else&#8217;s.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is helpful if a branch in your project has diverged or is specialized, but you want to be able to merge changes back in from it, and you want to ignore certain files.
Say you have a database settings file called <code>database.xml</code> that is different in two branches, and you want to merge in your other branch without messing up the database file.
You can set up an attribute like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">database.xml merge=ours</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And then define a dummy <code>ours</code> merge strategy with:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config --global merge.ours.driver true</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you merge in the other branch, instead of having merge conflicts with the <code>database.xml</code> file, you see something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git merge topic
Auto-merging database.xml
Merge made by recursive.</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, <code>database.xml</code> stays at whatever version you originally had.</p>

<h3 id="_git_hooks">Git Hooks</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Like many other Version Control Systems, Git has a way to fire off custom scripts when certain important actions occur.
There are two groups of these hooks: client-side and server-side.
Client-side hooks are triggered by operations such as committing and merging, while server-side hooks run on network operations such as receiving pushed commits.
You can use these hooks for all sorts of reasons.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_installing_a_hook">Installing a Hook</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The hooks are all stored in the <code>hooks</code> subdirectory of the Git directory.
In most projects, that&#8217;s <code>.git/hooks</code>.
When you initialize a new repository with <code>git init</code>, Git populates the hooks directory with a bunch of example scripts, many of which are useful by themselves; but they also document the input values of each script.
All the examples are written as shell scripts, with some Perl thrown in, but any properly named executable scripts will work fine – you can write them in Ruby or Python or whatever language you are familiar with.
If you want to use the bundled hook scripts, you&#8217;ll have to rename them; their file names all end with <code>.sample</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To enable a hook script, put a file in the <code>hooks</code> subdirectory of your .git directory that is named appropriately (without any extension) and is executable.
From that point forward, it should be called.
We&#8217;ll cover most of the major hook filenames here.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_client_side_hooks">Client-Side Hooks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a lot of client-side hooks.
This section splits them into committing-workflow hooks, email-workflow scripts, and everything else.</p>

<h5 id="_committing_workflow_hooks">Committing-Workflow Hooks</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first four hooks have to do with the committing process.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>pre-commit</code> hook is run first, before you even type in a commit message.
It&#8217;s used to inspect the snapshot that&#8217;s about to be committed, to see if you&#8217;ve forgotten something, to make sure tests run, or to examine whatever you need to inspect in the code.
Exiting non-zero from this hook aborts the commit, although you can bypass it with <code>git commit --no-verify</code>.
You can do things like check for code style (run <code>lint</code> or something equivalent), check for trailing whitespace (the default hook does exactly this), or check for appropriate documentation on new methods.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>prepare-commit-msg</code> hook is run before the commit message editor is fired up but after the default message is created.
It lets you edit the default message before the commit author sees it.
This hook takes a few parameters: the path to the file that holds the commit message so far, the type of commit, and the commit SHA-1 if this is an amended commit.
This hook generally isn&#8217;t useful for normal commits; rather, it&#8217;s good for commits where the default message is auto-generated, such as templated commit messages, merge commits, squashed commits, and amended commits.
You may use it in conjunction with a commit template to programmatically insert information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>commit-msg</code> hook takes one parameter, which again is the path to a temporary file that contains the commit message written by the developer.
If this script exits non-zero, Git aborts the commit process, so you can use it to validate your project state or commit message before allowing a commit to go through.
In the last section of this chapter, We&#8217;ll demonstrate using this hook to check that your commit message is conformant to a required pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After the entire commit process is completed, the <code>post-commit</code> hook runs.
It doesn&#8217;t take any parameters, but you can easily get the last commit by running <code>git log -1 HEAD</code>.
Generally, this script is used for notification or something similar.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_email_hooks">Email Workflow Hooks</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can set up three client-side hooks for an email-based workflow.
They&#8217;re all invoked by the <code>git am</code> command, so if you aren&#8217;t using that command in your workflow, you can safely skip to the next section.
If you&#8217;re taking patches over email prepared by <code>git format-patch</code>, then some of these may be helpful to you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first hook that is run is <code>applypatch-msg</code>.
It takes a single argument: the name of the temporary file that contains the proposed commit message.
Git aborts the patch if this script exits non-zero.
You can use this to make sure a commit message is properly formatted, or to normalize the message by having the script edit it in place.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next hook to run when applying patches via <code>git am</code> is <code>pre-applypatch</code>.
Somewhat confusingly, it is run <em>after</em> the patch is applied but before a commit is made, so you can use it to inspect the snapshot before making the commit.
You can run tests or otherwise inspect the working tree with this script.
If something is missing or the tests don&#8217;t pass, exiting non-zero aborts the <code>git am</code> script without committing the patch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last hook to run during a <code>git am</code> operation is <code>post-applypatch</code>, which runs after the commit is made.
You can use it to notify a group or the author of the patch you pulled in that you&#8217;ve done so.
You can&#8217;t stop the patching process with this script.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_other_client_hooks">Other Client Hooks</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>pre-rebase</code> hook runs before you rebase anything and can halt the process by exiting non-zero.
You can use this hook to disallow rebasing any commits that have already been pushed.
The example <code>pre-rebase</code> hook that Git installs does this, although it makes some assumptions that may not match with your workflow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>post-rewrite</code> hook is run by commands that replace commits, such as <code>git commit --amend</code> and <code>git rebase</code> (though not by <code>git filter-branch</code>).
Its single argument is which command triggered the rewrite, and it receives a list of rewrites on <code>stdin</code>.
This hook has many of the same uses as the <code>post-checkout</code> and <code>post-merge</code> hooks.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After you run a successful <code>git checkout</code>, the <code>post-checkout</code> hook runs; you can use it to set up your working directory properly for your project environment.
This may mean moving in large binary files that you don&#8217;t want source controlled, auto-generating documentation, or something along those lines.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>post-merge</code> hook runs after a successful <code>merge</code> command.
You can use it to restore data in the working tree that Git can&#8217;t track, such as permissions data.
This hook can likewise validate the presence of files external to Git control that you may want copied in when the working tree changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>pre-push</code> hook runs during <code>git push</code>, after the remote refs have been updated but before any objects have been transferred.
It receives the name and location of the remote as parameters, and a list of to-be-updated refs through <code>stdin</code>.
You can use it to validate a set of ref updates before a push occurs (a non-zero exit code will abort the push).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git occasionally does garbage collection as part of its normal operation, by invoking <code>git gc --auto</code>.
The <code>pre-auto-gc</code> hook is invoked just before the garbage collection takes place, and can be used to notify you that this is happening, or to abort the collection if now isn&#8217;t a good time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_server_side_hooks">Server-Side Hooks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In addition to the client-side hooks, you can use a couple of important server-side hooks as a system administrator to enforce nearly any kind of policy for your project.
These scripts run before and after pushes to the server.
The pre hooks can exit non-zero at any time to reject the push as well as print an error message back to the client; you can set up a push policy that&#8217;s as complex as you wish.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_pre_receive_code"><code>pre-receive</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first script to run when handling a push from a client is <code>pre-receive</code>.
It takes a list of references that are being pushed from stdin; if it exits non-zero, none of them are accepted.
You can use this hook to do things like make sure none of the updated references are non-fast-forwards, or to do access control for all the refs and files they&#8217;re modifying with the push.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_update_code"><code>update</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>update</code> script is very similar to the <code>pre-receive</code> script, except that it&#8217;s run once for each branch the pusher is trying to update.
If the pusher is trying to push to multiple branches, <code>pre-receive</code> runs only once, whereas update runs once per branch they&#8217;re pushing to.
Instead of reading from stdin, this script takes three arguments: the name of the reference (branch), the SHA-1 that reference pointed to before the push, and the SHA-1 the user is trying to push.
If the update script exits non-zero, only that reference is rejected; other references can still be updated.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_post_receive_code"><code>post-receive</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>post-receive</code> hook runs after the entire process is completed and can be used to update other services or notify users.
It takes the same stdin data as the <code>pre-receive</code> hook.
Examples include emailing a list, notifying a continuous integration server, or updating a ticket-tracking system – you can even parse the commit messages to see if any tickets need to be opened, modified, or closed.
This script can&#8217;t stop the push process, but the client doesn&#8217;t disconnect until it has completed, so be careful if you try to do anything that may take a long time.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_an_example_git_enforced_policy">An Example Git-Enforced Policy</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
In this section, you&#8217;ll use what you&#8217;ve learned to establish a Git workflow that checks for a custom commit message format, and allows only certain users to modify certain subdirectories in a project.
You&#8217;ll build client scripts that help the developer know if their push will be rejected and server scripts that actually enforce the policies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The scripts we&#8217;ll show are written in Ruby; partly because of our intellectual inertia, but also because Ruby is easy to read, even if you can&#8217;t necessarily write it.
However, any language will work – all the sample hook scripts distributed with Git are in either Perl or Bash, so you can also see plenty of examples of hooks in those languages by looking at the samples.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_server_side_hook">Server-Side Hook</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All the server-side work will go into the <code>update</code> file in your <code>hooks</code> directory.
The <code>update</code> hook runs once per branch being pushed and takes three arguments:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The name of the reference being pushed to</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The old revision where that branch was</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The new revision being pushed</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also have access to the user doing the pushing if the push is being run over SSH.
If you&#8217;ve allowed everyone to connect with a single user (like &#8220;git&#8221;) via public-key authentication, you may have to give that user a shell wrapper that determines which user is connecting based on the public key, and set an environment variable accordingly.
Here we&#8217;ll assume the connecting user is in the <code>$USER</code> environment variable, so your update script begins by gathering all the information you need:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">#!/usr/bin/env ruby

$refname = ARGV[0]
$oldrev  = ARGV[1]
$newrev  = ARGV[2]
$user    = ENV['USER']

puts "Enforcing Policies..."
puts "(#{$refname}) (#{$oldrev[0,6]}) (#{$newrev[0,6]})"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yes, those are global variables.
Don&#8217;t judge – it&#8217;s easier to demonstrate this way.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_enforcing_commit_message_format">Enforcing a Specific Commit-Message Format</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your first challenge is to enforce that each commit message adheres to a particular format.
Just to have a target, assume that each message has to include a string that looks like &#8220;ref: 1234&#8221; because you want each commit to link to a work item in your ticketing system.
You must look at each commit being pushed up, see if that string is in the commit message, and, if the string is absent from any of the commits, exit non-zero so the push is rejected.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can get a list of the SHA-1 values of all the commits that are being pushed by taking the <code>$newrev</code> and <code>$oldrev</code> values and passing them to a Git plumbing command called <code>git rev-list</code>.
This is basically the <code>git log</code> command, but by default it prints out only the SHA-1 values and no other information.
So, to get a list of all the commit SHA-1s introduced between one commit SHA-1 and another, you can run something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git rev-list 538c33..d14fc7

17716ec0f1ff5c77eff40b7fe912f9f6cfd0e475</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can take that output, loop through each of those commit SHA-1s, grab the message for it, and test that message against a regular expression that looks for a pattern.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have to figure out how to get the commit message from each of these commits to test.
To get the raw commit data, you can use another plumbing command called <code>git cat-file</code>.
We&#8217;ll go over all these plumbing commands in detail in <a href="#_git_internals">Git Internals</a>; but for now, here&#8217;s what that command gives you:</p>

<div class="listingblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A simple way to get the commit message from a commit when you have the SHA-1 value is to go to the first blank line and take everything after that.
You can do so with the <code>sed</code> command on Unix systems:</p>
</div>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can use that incantation to grab the commit message from each commit that is trying to be pushed and exit if you see anything that doesn&#8217;t match.
To exit the script and reject the push, exit non-zero.
The whole method looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">$regex = /\[ref: (\d+)\]/

    if !$regex.match(message)
      puts "[POLICY] Your message is not formatted correctly"
      exit 1
    end
  end
end
check_message_format</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Putting that in your <code>update</code> script will reject updates that contain commits that have messages that don&#8217;t adhere to your rule.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_enforcing_a_user_based_acl_system">Enforcing a User-Based ACL System</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose you want to add a mechanism that uses an access control list (ACL) that specifies which users are allowed to push changes to which parts of your projects.
Some people have full access, and others can only push changes to certain subdirectories or specific files.
To enforce this, you&#8217;ll write those rules to a file named <code>acl</code> that lives in your bare Git repository on the server.
You&#8217;ll have the <code>update</code> hook look at those rules, see what files are being introduced for all the commits being pushed, and determine whether the user doing the push has access to update all those files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing you&#8217;ll do is write your ACL.
Here you&#8217;ll use a format very much like the CVS ACL mechanism: it uses a series of lines, where the first field is <code>avail</code> or <code>unavail</code>, the next field is a comma-delimited list of the users to which the rule applies, and the last field is the path to which the rule applies (blank meaning open access).
All of these fields are delimited by a pipe (<code>|</code>) character.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, you have a couple of administrators, some documentation writers with access to the <code>doc</code> directory, and one developer who only has access to the <code>lib</code> and <code>tests</code> directories, and your ACL file looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>avail|nickh,pjhyett,defunkt,tpw
avail|usinclair,cdickens,ebronte|doc
avail|schacon|lib
avail|schacon|tests</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You begin by reading this data into a structure that you can use.
In this case, to keep the example simple, you&#8217;ll only enforce the <code>avail</code> directives.
Here is a method that gives you an associative array where the key is the user name and the value is an array of paths to which the user has write access:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">def get_acl_access_data(acl_file)
  # read in ACL data
  acl_file = File.read(acl_file).split("\n").reject { |line| line == '' }
  access = {}
  acl_file.each do |line|
    avail, users, path = line.split('|')
    next unless avail == 'avail'
    users.split(',').each do |user|
      access[user] ||= []
      access[user] &lt;&lt; path
    end
  end
  access
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On the ACL file you looked at earlier, this <code>get_acl_access_data</code> method returns a data structure that looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">{"defunkt"=&gt;[nil],

 "usinclair"=&gt;["doc"],
 "ebronte"=&gt;["doc"]}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you have the permissions sorted out, you need to determine what paths the commits being pushed have modified, so you can make sure the user who&#8217;s pushing has access to all of them.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_client_side_hooks_2">Client-Side Hooks</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The downside to this approach is the whining that will inevitably result when your users' commit pushes are rejected.
Having their carefully crafted work rejected at the last minute can be extremely frustrating and confusing; and furthermore, they will have to edit their history to correct it, which isn&#8217;t always for the faint of heart.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The answer to this dilemma is to provide some client-side hooks that users can run to notify them when they&#8217;re doing something that the server is likely to reject.
That way, they can correct any problems before committing and before those issues become more difficult to fix.
Because hooks aren&#8217;t transferred with a clone of a project, you must distribute these scripts some other way and then have your users copy them to their <code>.git/hooks</code> directory and make them executable.
You can distribute these hooks within the project or in a separate project, but Git won&#8217;t set them up automatically.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To begin, you should check your commit message just before each commit is recorded, so you know the server won&#8217;t reject your changes due to badly formatted commit messages.
To do this, you can add the <code>commit-msg</code> hook.
If you have it read the message from the file passed as the first argument and compare that to the pattern, you can force Git to abort the commit if there is no match:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">#!/usr/bin/env ruby
message_file = ARGV[0]
message = File.read(message_file)

$regex = /\[ref: (\d+)\]/

if !$regex.match(message)
  puts "[POLICY] Your message is not formatted correctly"
  exit 1
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If that script is in place (in <code>.git/hooks/commit-msg</code>) and executable, and you commit with a message that isn&#8217;t properly formatted, you see this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git commit -am 'test'
[POLICY] Your message is not formatted correctly</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>No commit was completed in that instance.
However, if your message contains the proper pattern, Git allows you to commit:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git commit -am 'test [ref: 132]'
[master e05c914] test [ref: 132]
 1 file changed, 1 insertions(+), 0 deletions(-)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, you want to make sure you aren&#8217;t modifying files that are outside your ACL scope.
If your project&#8217;s <code>.git</code> directory contains a copy of the ACL file you used previously, then the following <code>pre-commit</code> script will enforce those constraints for you:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">#!/usr/bin/env ruby

$user    = ENV['USER']

# [ insert acl_access_data method from above ]

# only allows certain users to modify certain subdirectories in a project
def check_directory_perms
  access = get_acl_access_data('.git/acl')

  files_modified = `git diff-index --cached --name-only HEAD`.split("\n")
  files_modified.each do |path|
    next if path.size == 0
    has_file_access = false
    access[$user].each do |access_path|
    if !access_path || (path.index(access_path) == 0)
      has_file_access = true
    end
    if !has_file_access
      puts "[POLICY] You do not have access to push to #{path}"
      exit 1
    end
  end
end

check_directory_perms</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is roughly the same script as the server-side part, but with two important differences.
First, the ACL file is in a different place, because this script runs from your working directory, not from your <code>.git</code> directory.
You have to change the path to the ACL file from this</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other important difference is the way you get a listing of the files that have been changed.
Because the server-side method looks at the log of commits, and, at this point, the commit hasn&#8217;t been recorded yet, you must get your file listing from the staging area instead.
Instead of</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But those are the only two differences – otherwise, the script works the same way.
One caveat is that it expects you to be running locally as the same user you push as to the remote machine.
If that is different, you must set the <code>$user</code> variable manually.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One other thing we can do here is make sure the user doesn&#8217;t push non-fast-forwarded references.
To get a reference that isn&#8217;t a fast-forward, you either have to rebase past a commit you&#8217;ve already pushed up or try pushing a different local branch up to the same remote branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Presumably, the server is already configured with <code>receive.denyDeletes</code> and <code>receive.denyNonFastForwards</code> to enforce this policy, so the only accidental thing you can try to catch is rebasing commits that have already been pushed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here is an example pre-rebase script that checks for that.
It gets a list of all the commits you&#8217;re about to rewrite and checks whether they exist in any of your remote references.
If it sees one that is reachable from one of your remote references, it aborts the rebase.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">#!/usr/bin/env ruby

base_branch = ARGV[0]
if ARGV[1]
  topic_branch = ARGV[1]
else
  topic_branch = "HEAD"
end

target_shas = `git rev-list #{base_branch}..#{topic_branch}`.split("\n")
remote_refs = `git branch -r`.split("\n").map { |r| r.strip }

target_shas.each do |sha|
  remote_refs.each do |remote_ref|
    shas_pushed = `git rev-list ^#{sha}^@ refs/remotes/#{remote_ref}`
    if shas_pushed.split("\n").include?(sha)
      puts "[POLICY] Commit #{sha} has already been pushed to #{remote_ref}"
      exit 1
    end
  end
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This script uses a syntax that wasn&#8217;t covered in <a href="#_revision_selection">Revision Selection</a>.
You get a list of commits that have already been pushed up by running this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">`git rev-list ^#{sha}^@ refs/remotes/#{remote_ref}`</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>SHA^@</code> syntax resolves to all the parents of that commit.
You&#8217;re looking for any commit that is reachable from the last commit on the remote and that isn&#8217;t reachable from any parent of any of the SHA-1s you&#8217;re trying to push up – meaning it&#8217;s a fast-forward.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main drawback to this approach is that it can be very slow and is often unnecessary – if you don&#8217;t try to force the push with <code>-f</code>, the server will warn you and not accept the push.
However, it&#8217;s an interesting exercise and can in theory help you avoid a rebase that you might later have to go back and fix.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The world isn&#8217;t perfect.
Usually, you can&#8217;t immediately switch every project you come in contact with to Git.
Sometimes you&#8217;re stuck on a project using another VCS, and wish it was Git.
We&#8217;ll spend the first part of this chapter learning about ways to use Git as a client when the project you&#8217;re working on is hosted in a different system.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point, you may want to convert your existing project to Git.

<h3 id="_git_as_a_client">Git as a Client</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Git provides such a nice experience for developers that many people have figured out how to use it on their workstation, even if the rest of their team is using an entirely different VCS.
There are a number of these adapters, called &#8220;bridges,&#8221; available.
Here we&#8217;ll cover the ones you&#8217;re most likely to run into in the wild.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_svn">Git and Subversion</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
A large fraction of open source development projects and a good number of corporate projects use Subversion to manage their source code.
It&#8217;s been around for more than a decade, and for most of that time was the <em>de facto</em> VCS choice for open-source projects.
It&#8217;s also very similar in many ways to CVS, which was the big boy of the source-control world before that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
One of Git&#8217;s great features is a bidirectional bridge to Subversion called <code>git svn</code>.
This tool allows you to use Git as a valid client to a Subversion server, so you can use all the local features of Git and then push to a Subversion server as if you were using Subversion locally.
This means you can do local branching and merging, use the staging area, use rebasing and cherry-picking, and so on, while your collaborators continue to work in their dark and ancient ways.
It&#8217;s a good way to sneak Git into the corporate environment and help your fellow developers become more efficient while you lobby to get the infrastructure changed to support Git fully.
The Subversion bridge is the gateway drug to the DVCS world.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="__code_git_svn_code"><code>git svn</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The base command in Git for all the Subversion bridging commands is <code>git svn</code>.
It takes quite a few commands, so we&#8217;ll show the most common while going through a few simple workflows.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that when you&#8217;re using <code>git svn</code>, you&#8217;re interacting with Subversion, which is a system that works very differently from Git.
Although you <strong>can</strong> do local branching and merging, it&#8217;s generally best to keep your history as linear as possible by rebasing your work, and avoiding doing things like simultaneously interacting with a Git remote repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Don&#8217;t rewrite your history and try to push again, and don&#8217;t push to a parallel Git repository to collaborate with fellow Git developers at the same time.
Subversion can have only a single linear history, and confusing it is very easy.
If you&#8217;re working with a team, and some are using SVN and others are using Git, make sure everyone is using the SVN server to collaborate – doing so will make your life easier.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_setting_up">Setting Up</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To demonstrate this functionality, you need a typical SVN repository that you have write access to.
If you want to copy these examples, you&#8217;ll have to make a writeable copy of my test repository.
In order to do that easily, you can use a tool called <code>svnsync</code> that comes with Subversion.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To follow along, you first need to create a new local Subversion repository:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ mkdir /tmp/test-svn
$ svnadmin create /tmp/test-svn</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, enable all users to change revprops – the easy way is to add a <code>pre-revprop-change</code> script that always exits 0:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat /tmp/test-svn/hooks/pre-revprop-change
#!/bin/sh
exit 0;
$ chmod +x /tmp/test-svn/hooks/pre-revprop-change</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can now sync this project to your local machine by calling <code>svnsync init</code> with the to and from repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ svnsync init file:///tmp/test-svn \
  http://your-svn-server.example.org/svn/</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This sets up the properties to run the sync.
You can then clone the code by running</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ svnsync sync file:///tmp/test-svn
Committed revision 1.
Copied properties for revision 1.
Transmitting file data .............................[...]
Committed revision 2.
Copied properties for revision 2.
[…]</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Although this operation may take only a few minutes, if you try to copy the original repository to another remote repository instead of a local one, the process will take nearly an hour, even though there are fewer than 100 commits.
Subversion has to clone one revision at a time and then push it back into another repository – it&#8217;s ridiculously inefficient, but it&#8217;s the only easy way to do this.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_getting_started_2">Getting Started</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you have a Subversion repository to which you have write access, you can go through a typical workflow.
You&#8217;ll start with the <code>git svn clone</code> command, which imports an entire Subversion repository into a local Git repository.
Remember that if you&#8217;re importing from a real hosted Subversion repository, you should replace the <code>file:///tmp/test-svn</code> here with the URL of your Subversion repository:</p>

For a project with hundreds or thousands of commits, this can literally take hours or even days to finish.</p>

<p>The <code>-T trunk -b branches -t tags</code> part tells Git that this Subversion repository follows the basic branching and tagging conventions.

<p>Now that you have a working repository, you can do some work on the project and push your commits back upstream, using Git effectively as a SVN client.
If you edit one of the files and commit it, you have a commit that exists in Git locally that doesn&#8217;t exist on the Subversion server:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, you need to push your change upstream.
Notice how this changes the way you work with Subversion – you can do several commits offline and then push them all at once to the Subversion server.
To push to a Subversion server, you run the <code>git svn dcommit</code> command:</p>

<p>This takes all the commits you&#8217;ve made on top of the Subversion server code, does a Subversion commit for each, and then rewrites your local Git commit to include a unique identifier.
This is important because it means that all the SHA-1 checksums for your commits change.
Partly for this reason, working with Git-based remote versions of your projects concurrently with a Subversion server isn&#8217;t a good idea.

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you&#8217;ve become comfortable with a Git workflow, you&#8217;ll likely create topic branches, do work on them, and then merge them in.
If you&#8217;re pushing to a Subversion server via <code>git svn</code>, you may want to rebase your work onto a single branch each time instead of merging branches together.
The reason to prefer rebasing is that Subversion has a linear history and doesn&#8217;t deal with merges like Git does, so <code>git svn</code> follows only the first parent when converting the snapshots into Subversion commits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Suppose your history looks like the following: you created an <code>experiment</code> branch, did two commits, and then merged them back into <code>master</code>.

<p>This does the equivalent of the <code>svn copy trunk branches/opera</code> command in Subversion and operates on the Subversion server.

<p>Git figures out what branch your dcommits go to by looking for the tip of any of your Subversion branches in your history – you should have only one, and it should be the last one with a <code>git-svn-id</code> in your current branch history.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to work on more than one branch simultaneously, you can set up local branches to <code>dcommit</code> to specific Subversion branches by starting them at the imported Subversion commit for that branch.

<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch opera remotes/origin/opera</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, if you want to merge your <code>opera</code> branch into <code>trunk</code> (your <code>master</code> branch), you can do so with a normal <code>git merge</code>.
But you need to provide a descriptive commit message (via <code>-m</code>), or the merge will say &#8220;Merge branch opera&#8221; instead of something useful.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remember that although you&#8217;re using <code>git merge</code> to do this operation, and the merge likely will be much easier than it would be in Subversion (because Git will automatically detect the appropriate merge base for you), this isn&#8217;t a normal Git merge commit.
You have to push this data back to a Subversion server that can&#8217;t handle a commit that tracks more than one parent; so, after you push it up, it will look like a single commit that squashed in all the work of another branch under a single commit.
After you merge one branch into another, you can&#8217;t easily go back and continue working on that branch, as you normally can in Git.
The <code>dcommit</code> command that you run erases any information that says what branch was merged in, so subsequent merge-base calculations will be wrong – the dcommit makes your <code>git merge</code> result look like you ran <code>git merge --squash</code>.
Unfortunately, there&#8217;s no good way to avoid this situation – Subversion can&#8217;t store this information, so you&#8217;ll always be crippled by its limitations while you&#8217;re using it as your server.
To avoid issues, you should delete the local branch (in this case, <code>opera</code>) after you merge it into trunk.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you clone a Subversion repository that has <code>svn:ignore</code> properties set anywhere, you&#8217;ll likely want to set corresponding <code>.gitignore</code> files so you don&#8217;t accidentally commit files that you shouldn&#8217;t.
<code>git svn</code> has two commands to help with this issue.
The first is <code>git svn create-ignore</code>, which automatically creates corresponding <code>.gitignore</code> files for you so your next commit can include them.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second command is <code>git svn show-ignore</code>, which prints to stdout the lines you need to put in a <code>.gitignore</code> file so you can redirect the output into your project exclude file:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git svn show-ignore &gt; .git/info/exclude</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That way, you don&#8217;t litter the project with <code>.gitignore</code> files.
This is a good option if you&#8217;re the only Git user on a Subversion team, and your teammates don&#8217;t want <code>.gitignore</code> files in the project.</p>

<h5 id="_git_svn_summary">Git-Svn Summary</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git svn</code> tools are useful if you&#8217;re stuck with a Subversion server, or are otherwise in a development environment that necessitates running a Subversion server.
You should consider it crippled Git, however, or you&#8217;ll hit issues in translation that may confuse you and your collaborators.
To stay out of trouble, try to follow these guidelines:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Keep a linear Git history that doesn&#8217;t contain merge commits made by <code>git merge</code>.
Rebase any work you do outside of your mainline branch back onto it; don&#8217;t merge it in.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Don&#8217;t set up and collaborate on a separate Git server.
Possibly have one to speed up clones for new developers, but don&#8217;t push anything to it that doesn&#8217;t have a <code>git-svn-id</code> entry.
You may even want to add a <code>pre-receive</code> hook that checks each commit message for a <code>git-svn-id</code> and rejects pushes that contain commits without it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you follow those guidelines, working with a Subversion server can be more bearable.
However, if it&#8217;s possible to move to a real Git server, doing so can gain your team a lot more.</p>

<h4 id="_git_and_mercurial">Git and Mercurial</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

The DVCS universe is larger than just Git.
In fact, there are many other systems in this space, each with their own angle on how to do distributed version control correctly.
Apart from Git, the most popular is Mercurial, and the two are very similar in many respects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The good news, if you prefer Git&#8217;s client-side behavior but are working with a project whose source code is controlled with Mercurial, is that there&#8217;s a way to use Git as a client for a Mercurial-hosted repository.
Since the way Git talks to server repositories is through remotes, it should come as no surprise that this bridge is implemented as a remote helper.
The project&#8217;s name is git-remote-hg, and it can be found at <a href="https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-hg" class="bare">https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-hg</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_git_remote_hg">git-remote-hg</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, you need to install git-remote-hg.
This basically entails dropping its file somewhere in your path, like so:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ curl -o ~/bin/git-remote-hg \
  https://raw.githubusercontent.com/felipec/git-remote-hg/master/git-remote-hg
$ chmod +x ~/bin/git-remote-hg</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>…assuming <code>~/bin</code> is in your <code>$PATH</code>.
Git-remote-hg has one other dependency: the <code>mercurial</code> library for Python.
If you have Python installed, this is as simple as:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ pip install mercurial</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>(If you don&#8217;t have Python installed, visit <a href="https://www.python.org/" class="bare">https://www.python.org/</a> and get it first.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last thing you&#8217;ll need is the Mercurial client.
Go to <a href="https://www.mercurial-scm.org/" class="bare">https://www.mercurial-scm.org/</a> and install it if you haven&#8217;t already.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you&#8217;re ready to rock.
All you need is a Mercurial repository you can push to.
Fortunately, every Mercurial repository can act this way, so we&#8217;ll just use the "hello world" repository everyone uses to learn Mercurial:</p>

As you&#8217;ll see, these two systems are similar enough that there isn&#8217;t much friction.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As always with Git, first we clone:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone hg::/tmp/hello /tmp/hello-git
$ cd /tmp/hello-git
$ git log --oneline --graph --decorate
* ac7955c (HEAD, origin/master, origin/branches/default, origin/HEAD, refs/hg/origin/branches/default, refs/hg/origin/bookmarks/master, master) Create a makefile
* 65bb417 Create a standard "hello, world" program</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll notice that working with a Mercurial repository uses the standard <code>git clone</code> command.
That&#8217;s because git-remote-hg is working at a fairly low level, using a similar mechanism to how Git&#8217;s HTTP/S protocol is implemented (remote helpers).
Since Git and Mercurial are both designed for every client to have a full copy of the repository history, this command makes a full clone, including all the project&#8217;s history, and does it fairly quickly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The log command shows two commits, the latest of which is pointed to by a whole slew of refs.
It turns out some of these aren&#8217;t actually there.
Let&#8217;s take a look at what&#8217;s actually in the <code>.git</code> directory:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ tree .git/refs
.git/refs
├── heads
│   └── master
├── hg
│   └── origin
│       ├── bookmarks
│       │   └── master
│       └── branches
│           └── default
├── notes
│   └── hg
├── remotes
│   └── origin
│       └── HEAD
└── tags

9 directories, 5 files</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git-remote-hg is trying to make things more idiomatically Git-esque, but under the hood it&#8217;s managing the conceptual mapping between two slightly different systems.
The <code>refs/hg</code> directory is where the actual remote refs are stored.
For example, the <code>refs/hg/origin/branches/default</code> is a Git ref file that contains the SHA-1 starting with &#8220;ac7955c&#8221;, which is the commit that <code>master</code> points to.
So the <code>refs/hg</code> directory is kind of like a fake <code>refs/remotes/origin</code>, but it has the added distinction between bookmarks and branches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>notes/hg</code> file is the starting point for how git-remote-hg maps Git commit hashes to Mercurial changeset IDs.
Let&#8217;s explore a bit:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat notes/hg
d4c10386...

$ git cat-file -p d4c10386...
tree 1781c96...
author remote-hg &lt;&gt; 1408066400 -0800
committer remote-hg &lt;&gt; 1408066400 -0800

Notes for master

$ git ls-tree 1781c96...
100644 blob ac9117f...	65bb417...
100644 blob 485e178...	ac7955c...

$ git cat-file -p ac9117f
0a04b987be5ae354b710cefeba0e2d9de7ad41a9</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So <code>refs/notes/hg</code> points to a tree, which in the Git object database is a list of other objects with names.
<code>git ls-tree</code> outputs the mode, type, object hash, and filename for items inside a tree.
Once we dig down to one of the tree items, we find that inside it is a blob named &#8220;ac9117f&#8221; (the SHA-1 hash of the commit pointed to by <code>master</code>), with contents &#8220;0a04b98&#8221; (which is the ID of the Mercurial changeset at the tip of the <code>default</code> branch).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The good news is that we mostly don&#8217;t have to worry about all of this.
The typical workflow won&#8217;t be very different from working with a Git remote.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s one more thing we should attend to before we continue: ignores.
Mercurial and Git use a very similar mechanism for this, but it&#8217;s likely you don&#8217;t want to actually commit a <code>.gitignore</code> file into a Mercurial repository.
Fortunately, Git has a way to ignore files that&#8217;s local to an on-disk repository, and the Mercurial format is compatible with Git, so you just have to copy it over:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cp .hgignore .git/info/exclude</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>.git/info/exclude</code> file acts just like a <code>.gitignore</code>, but isn&#8217;t included in commits.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_workflow">Workflow</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s assume we&#8217;ve done some work and made some commits on the <code>master</code> branch, and you&#8217;re ready to push it to the remote repository.
Here&#8217;s what our repository looks like right now:</p>

<p>Since we used the <code>--all</code> flag, we see the &#8220;notes&#8221; refs that are used internally by git-remote-hg, but we can ignore them.

<h5 id="_branches_and_bookmarks">Branches and Bookmarks</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git has only one kind of branch: a reference that moves when commits are made.
In Mercurial, this kind of a reference is called a &#8220;bookmark,&#8221; and it behaves in much the same way as a Git branch.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Mercurial&#8217;s concept of a &#8220;branch&#8221; is more heavyweight.
The branch that a changeset is made on is recorded <em>with the changeset</em>, which means it will always be in the repository history.
Here&#8217;s an example of a commit that was made on the <code>develop</code> branch:</p>

Git can&#8217;t really replicate this (and doesn&#8217;t need to; both types of branch can be represented as a Git ref), but git-remote-hg needs to understand the difference, because Mercurial cares.</p>

<h4 id="_git_and_bazaar">Git and Bazaar</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Among the DVCS, another famous one is <a href="http://bazaar.canonical.com/">Bazaar</a>.
Bazaar is free and open source, and is part of the <a href="http://www.gnu.org/">GNU Project</a>.
It behaves very differently from Git.
Sometimes, to do the same thing as with Git, you have to use a different keyword, and some keywords that are common don&#8217;t have the same meaning.
In particular, the branch management is very different and may cause confusion, especially when someone comes from Git&#8217;s universe.
Nevertheless, it is possible to work on a Bazaar repository from a Git one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are many projects that allow you to use Git as a Bazaar client.
Here we&#8217;ll use Felipe Contreras' project that you may find at <a href="https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-bzr" class="bare">https://github.com/felipec/git-remote-bzr</a>.
To install it, you just have to download the file git-remote-bzr in a folder contained in your <code>$PATH</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ wget https://raw.github.com/felipec/git-remote-bzr/master/git-remote-bzr -O ~/bin/git-remote-bzr
$ chmod +x ~/bin/git-remote-bzr</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You also need to have Bazaar installed.
That&#8217;s all!</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_create_a_git_repository_from_a_bazaar_repository">Create a Git repository from a Bazaar repository</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is simple to use.
It is enough to clone a Bazaar repository prefixing it by <code>bzr::</code>.
Since Git and Bazaar both do full clones to your machine, it&#8217;s possible to attach a Git clone to your local Bazaar clone, but it isn&#8217;t recommended.
It&#8217;s much easier to attach your Git clone directly to the same place your Bazaar clone is attached to ‒ the central repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s suppose that you worked with a remote repository which is at address <code>bzr+ssh://developer@mybazaarserver:myproject</code>.
Then you must clone it in the following way:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone bzr::bzr+ssh://developer@mybazaarserver:myproject myProject-Git
$ cd myProject-Git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, your Git repository is created but it is not compacted for optimal disk use.
That&#8217;s why you should also clean and compact your Git repository, especially if it is a big one:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git gc --aggressive</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_bazaar_branches">Bazaar branches</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bazaar only allows you to clone branches, but a repository may contain several branches, and <code>git-remote-bzr</code> can clone both.
For example, to clone a branch:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone bzr::bzr://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/emacs/trunk emacs-trunk</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And to clone the whole repository:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone bzr::bzr://bzr.savannah.gnu.org/emacs emacs</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second command clones all the branches contained in the emacs repository; nevertheless, it is possible to point out some branches:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git config remote-bzr.branches 'trunk, xwindow'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Some remote repositories don&#8217;t allow to list their branches, in which case you have to manually specify them, and even though you could specify the configuration in the cloning command, you may find this easier:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git init emacs

<h4 id="_git_and_perforce">Git and Perforce</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

Perforce is a very popular version-control system in corporate environments.
It&#8217;s been around since 1995, which makes it the oldest system covered in this chapter.
As such, it&#8217;s designed with the constraints of its day; it assumes you&#8217;re always connected to a single central server, and only one version is kept on the local disk.
To be sure, its features and constraints are well-suited to several specific problems, but there are lots of projects using Perforce where Git would actually work better.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two options if you&#8217;d like to mix your use of Perforce and Git.
The first one we&#8217;ll cover is the &#8220;Git Fusion&#8221; bridge from the makers of Perforce, which lets you expose subtrees of your Perforce depot as read-write Git repositories.
The second is git-p4, a client-side bridge that lets you use Git as a Perforce client, without requiring any reconfiguration of the Perforce server.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_p4_git_fusion">Git Fusion</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Perforce provides a product called Git Fusion (available at <a href="http://www.perforce.com/git-fusion" class="bare">http://www.perforce.com/git-fusion</a>), which synchronizes a Perforce server with Git repositories on the server side.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_setting_up_2">Setting Up</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For our examples, we&#8217;ll be using the easiest installation method for Git Fusion, which is downloading a virtual machine that runs the Perforce daemon and Git Fusion.
You can get the virtual machine image from <a href="http://www.perforce.com/downloads/Perforce/20-User" class="bare">http://www.perforce.com/downloads/Perforce/20-User</a>, and once it&#8217;s finished downloading, import it into your favorite virtualization software (we&#8217;ll use VirtualBox).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Upon first starting the machine, it asks you to customize the password for three Linux users (<code>root</code>, <code>perforce</code>, and <code>git</code>), and provide an instance name, which can be used to distinguish this installation from others on the same network.
When that has all completed, you&#8217;ll see this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/git-fusion-boot.png" alt="The Git Fusion virtual machine boot screen.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 146. The Git Fusion virtual machine boot screen.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should take note of the IP address that&#8217;s shown here, we&#8217;ll be using it later on.
Next, we&#8217;ll create a Perforce user.
Select the &#8220;Login&#8221; option at the bottom and press enter (or SSH to the machine), and log in as <code>root</code>.
Then use these commands to create a user:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ p4 -p localhost:1666 -u super user -f john
$ p4 -p localhost:1666 -u john passwd
$ exit</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first one will open a VI editor to customize the user, but you can accept the defaults by typing <code>:wq</code> and hitting enter.
The second one will prompt you to enter a password twice.
That&#8217;s all we need to do with a shell prompt, so exit out of the session.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next thing you&#8217;ll need to do to follow along is to tell Git not to verify SSL certificates.
The Git Fusion image comes with a certificate, but it&#8217;s for a domain that won&#8217;t match your virtual machine&#8217;s IP address, so Git will reject the HTTPS connection.
If this is going to be a permanent installation, consult the Perforce Git Fusion manual to install a different certificate; for our example purposes, this will suffice:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ export GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY=true</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now we can test that everything is working.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone https://10.0.1.254/Talkhouse

<p>The virtual-machine image comes equipped with a sample project that you can clone.
Here we&#8217;re cloning over HTTPS, with the <code>john</code> user that we created above; Git asks for credentials for this connection, but the credential cache will allow us to skip this step for any subsequent requests.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_fusion_configuration">Fusion Configuration</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you&#8217;ve got Git Fusion installed, you&#8217;ll want to tweak the configuration.
This is actually fairly easy to do using your favorite Perforce client; just map the <code>//.git-fusion</code> directory on the Perforce server into your workspace.
The file structure looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ tree

├── objects

├── repos
│   └── Talkhouse
│       └── p4gf_config
└── users
    └── p4gf_usermap

498 directories, 287 files</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>objects</code> directory is used internally by Git Fusion to map Perforce objects to Git and vice versa, you won&#8217;t have to mess with anything in there.
There&#8217;s a global <code>p4gf_config</code> file in this directory, as well as one for each repository – these are the configuration files that determine how Git Fusion behaves.
Let&#8217;s take a look at the file in the root:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[repo-creation]
charset = utf8

[git-to-perforce]
change-owner = author
enable-git-branch-creation = yes
enable-swarm-reviews = yes
enable-git-merge-commits = yes
enable-git-submodules = yes
preflight-commit = none
ignore-author-permissions = no
read-permission-check = none
git-merge-avoidance-after-change-num = 12107

[perforce-to-git]
http-url = none
ssh-url = none

[@features]
imports = False
chunked-push = False
matrix2 = False
parallel-push = False

[authentication]
email-case-sensitivity = no</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We won&#8217;t go into the meanings of these flags here, but note that this is just an INI-formatted text file, much like Git uses for configuration.
This file specifies the global options, which can then be overridden by repository-specific configuration files, like <code>repos/Talkhouse/p4gf_config</code>.
If you open this file, you&#8217;ll see a <code>[@repo]</code> section with some settings that are different from the global defaults.
You&#8217;ll also see sections that look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[Talkhouse-master]
git-branch-name = master
view = //depot/Talkhouse/main-dev/... ...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a mapping between a Perforce branch and a Git branch.
The section can be named whatever you like, so long as the name is unique.
<code>git-branch-name</code> lets you convert a depot path that would be cumbersome under Git to a more friendly name.
The <code>view</code> setting controls how Perforce files are mapped into the Git repository, using the standard view mapping syntax.
More than one mapping can be specified, like in this example:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[multi-project-mapping]
git-branch-name = master
view = //depot/project1/main/... project1/...
       //depot/project2/mainline/... project2/...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This way, if your normal workspace mapping includes changes in the structure of the directories, you can replicate that with a Git repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last file we&#8217;ll discuss is <code>users/p4gf_usermap</code>, which maps Perforce users to Git users, and which you may not even need.
When converting from a Perforce changeset to a Git commit, Git Fusion&#8217;s default behavior is to look up the Perforce user, and use the email address and full name stored there for the author/committer field in Git.
When converting the other way, the default is to look up the Perforce user with the email address stored in the Git commit&#8217;s author field, and submit the changeset as that user (with permissions applying).
In most cases, this behavior will do just fine, but consider the following mapping file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>john john@example.com "John Doe"
john johnny@appleseed.net "John Doe"
bob employeeX@example.com "Anon X. Mouse"
joe employeeY@example.com "Anon Y. Mouse"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each line is of the format <code>&lt;user&gt; &lt;email&gt; "&lt;full name&gt;"</code>, and creates a single user mapping.
The first two lines map two distinct email addresses to the same Perforce user account.
This is useful if you&#8217;ve created Git commits under several different email addresses (or change email addresses), but want them to be mapped to the same Perforce user.
When creating a Git commit from a Perforce changeset, the first line matching the Perforce user is used for Git authorship information.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last two lines mask Bob and Joe&#8217;s actual names and email addresses from the Git commits that are created.
This is nice if you want to open-source an internal project, but don&#8217;t want to publish your employee directory to the entire world.
Note that the email addresses and full names should be unique, unless you want all the Git commits to be attributed to a single fictional author.</p>

<p>Perforce Git Fusion is a two-way bridge between Perforce and Git version control.
Let&#8217;s have a look at how it feels to work from the Git side.
We&#8217;ll assume we&#8217;ve mapped in the &#8220;Jam&#8221; project using a configuration file as shown above, which we can clone like this:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first time you do this, it may take some time.
What&#8217;s happening is that Git Fusion is converting all the applicable changesets in the Perforce history into Git commits.
This happens locally on the server, so it&#8217;s relatively fast, but if you have a lot of history, it can still take some time.
Subsequent fetches do incremental conversion, so it&#8217;ll feel more like Git&#8217;s native speed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As you can see, our repository looks exactly like any other Git repository you might work with.
There are three branches, and Git has helpfully created a local <code>master</code> branch that tracks <code>origin/master</code>.

<p>Git thinks it worked.
Let&#8217;s take a look at the history of the <code>README</code> file from Perforce&#8217;s point of view, using the revision graph feature of <code>p4v</code>:</p>

<div class="imageblock">

<div class="title">Figure 147. Perforce revision graph resulting from Git push.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;ve never seen this view before, it may seem confusing, but it shows the same concepts as a graphical viewer for Git history.
We&#8217;re looking at the history of the <code>README</code> file, so the directory tree at top left only shows that file as it surfaces in various branches.
At top right, we have a visual graph of how different revisions of the file are related, and the big-picture view of this graph is at bottom right.
The rest of the view is given to the details view for the selected revision (<code>2</code> in this case).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One thing to notice is that the graph looks exactly like the one in Git&#8217;s history.
Perforce didn&#8217;t have a named branch to store the <code>1</code> and <code>2</code> commits, so it made an &#8220;anonymous&#8221; branch in the <code>.git-fusion</code> directory to hold it.
This will also happen for named Git branches that don&#8217;t correspond to a named Perforce branch (and you can later map them to a Perforce branch using the configuration file).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of this happens behind the scenes, but the end result is that one person on a team can be using Git, another can be using Perforce, and neither of them will know about the other&#8217;s choice.</p>

<h6 id="_git_fusion_summary">Git-Fusion Summary</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have (or can get) access to your Perforce server, Git Fusion is a great way to make Git and Perforce talk to each other.
There&#8217;s a bit of configuration involved, but the learning curve isn&#8217;t very steep.
This is one of the few sections in this chapter where cautions about using Git&#8217;s full power will not appear.
That&#8217;s not to say that Perforce will be happy with everything you throw at it – if you try to rewrite history that&#8217;s already been pushed, Git Fusion will reject it – but Git Fusion tries very hard to feel native.
You can even use Git submodules (though they&#8217;ll look strange to Perforce users), and merge branches (this will be recorded as an integration on the Perforce side).</p>

<p>Looks like they were, and <code>master</code> and <code>p4/master</code> have diverged.
Perforce&#8217;s branching system is <em>nothing</em> like Git&#8217;s, so submitting merge commits doesn&#8217;t make any sense.
Git-p4 recommends that you rebase your commits, and even comes with a shortcut to do so:</p>

<p>You can probably tell from the output, but <code>git p4 rebase</code> is a shortcut for <code>git p4 sync</code> followed by <code>git rebase p4/master</code>.
It&#8217;s a bit smarter than that, especially when working with multiple branches, but this is a good approximation.</p>
</div>

<p>Now our history is linear again, and we&#8217;re ready to contribute our changes back to Perforce.
The <code>git p4 submit</code> command will try to create a new Perforce revision for every Git commit between <code>p4/master</code> and <code>master</code>.

<p>This is mostly the same content you&#8217;d see by running <code>p4 submit</code>, except the stuff at the end which git-p4 has helpfully included.
Git-p4 tries to honor your Git and Perforce settings individually when it has to provide a name for a commit or changeset, but in some cases you want to override it.
For example, if the Git commit you&#8217;re importing was written by a contributor who doesn&#8217;t have a Perforce user account, you may still want the resulting changeset to look like they write it (and not you).</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Git and Perforce history diverge after 775a46f.
The Git side has two commits, then a merge commit with the Perforce head, then another commit.
We&#8217;re going to try to submit these on top of a single changeset on the Perforce side.
Let&#8217;s see what would happen if we tried to submit now:</p>

In this case, it looks like we&#8217;d be creating three Perforce changesets, which correspond to the three non-merge commits that don&#8217;t yet exist on the Perforce server.
That sounds like exactly what we want, let&#8217;s see how it turns out:</p>

<p>Our history became linear, just as though we had rebased before submitting (which is in fact exactly what happened).
This means you can be free to create, work on, throw away, and merge branches on the Git side without fear that your history will somehow become incompatible with Perforce.
If you can rebase it, you can contribute it to a Perforce server.</p>

<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_git_p4_branches">Branching</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your Perforce project has multiple branches, you&#8217;re not out of luck; git-p4 can handle that in a way that makes it feel like Git.
Let&#8217;s say your Perforce depot is laid out like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>//depot
  └── project
      ├── main
      └── dev</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>And let&#8217;s say you have a <code>dev</code> branch, which has a view spec that looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>//depot/project/main/... //depot/project/dev/...</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git-p4 can automatically detect that situation and do the right thing:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git p4 clone --detect-branches //depot/project@all
Importing from //depot/project@all into project
Initialized empty Git repository in /private/tmp/project/.git/

$ cd project; git log --oneline --all --graph --decorate

| * a43cfae Populate //depot/project/main/... //depot/project/dev/....
|/
* 2b83451 Project init</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note the &#8220;@all&#8221; specifier in the depot path; that tells git-p4 to clone not just the latest changeset for that subtree, but all changesets that have ever touched those paths.
This is closer to Git&#8217;s concept of a clone, but if you&#8217;re working on a project with a long history, it could take a while.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>--detect-branches</code> flag tells git-p4 to use Perforce&#8217;s branch specs to map the branches to Git refs.
If these mappings aren&#8217;t present on the Perforce server (which is a perfectly valid way to use Perforce), you can tell git-p4 what the branch mappings are, and you get the same result:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git init project
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/project/.git/
$ cd project
$ git config git-p4.branchList main:dev
$ git clone --detect-branches //depot/project@all .</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Setting the <code>git-p4.branchList</code> configuration variable to <code>main:dev</code> tells git-p4 that &#8220;main&#8221; and &#8220;dev&#8221; are both branches, and the second one is a child of the first one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If we now <code>git checkout -b dev p4/project/dev</code> and make some commits, git-p4 is smart enough to target the right branch when we do <code>git p4 submit</code>.
Unfortunately, git-p4 can&#8217;t mix shallow clones and multiple branches; if you have a huge project and want to work on more than one branch, you&#8217;ll have to <code>git p4 clone</code> once for each branch you want to submit to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For creating or integrating branches, you&#8217;ll have to use a Perforce client.
Git-p4 can only sync and submit to existing branches, and it can only do it one linear changeset at a time.
If you merge two branches in Git and try to submit the new changeset, all that will be recorded is a bunch of file changes; the metadata about which branches are involved in the integration will be lost.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_git_and_perforce_summary">Git and Perforce Summary</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git-p4 makes it possible to use a Git workflow with a Perforce server, and it&#8217;s pretty good at it.
However, it&#8217;s important to remember that Perforce is in charge of the source, and you&#8217;re only using Git to work locally.
Just be really careful about sharing Git commits; if you have a remote that other people use, don&#8217;t push any commits that haven&#8217;t already been submitted to the Perforce server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want to freely mix the use of Perforce and Git as clients for source control, and you can convince the server administrator to install it, Git Fusion makes using Git a first-class version-control client for a Perforce server.</p>

<h4 id="_git_and_tfs">Git and TFS</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

Git is becoming popular with Windows developers, and if you&#8217;re writing code on Windows, there&#8217;s a good chance you&#8217;re using Microsoft&#8217;s Team Foundation Server (TFS).
TFS is a collaboration suite that includes defect and work-item tracking, process support for Scrum and others, code review, and version control.
There&#8217;s a bit of confusion ahead: <strong>TFS</strong> is the server, which supports controlling source code using both Git and their own custom VCS, which they&#8217;ve dubbed <strong>TFVC</strong> (Team Foundation Version Control).
Git support is a somewhat new feature for TFS (shipping with the 2013 version), so all of the tools that predate that refer to the version-control portion as &#8220;TFS&#8221;, even though they&#8217;re mostly working with TFVC.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you find yourself on a team that&#8217;s using TFVC but you&#8217;d rather use Git as your version-control client, there&#8217;s a project for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_which_tool">Which Tool</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
In fact, there are two: git-tf and git-tfs.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git-tfs (found at <a href="https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs" class="bare">https://github.com/git-tfs/git-tfs</a>) is a .NET project, and (as of this writing) it only runs on Windows.
To work with Git repositories, it uses the .NET bindings for libgit2, a library-oriented implementation of Git which is highly performant and allows a lot of flexibility with the guts of a Git repository.
Libgit2 is not a complete implementation of Git, so to cover the difference git-tfs will actually call the command-line Git client for some operations, so there are no artificial limits on what it can do with Git repositories.
Its support of TFVC features is very mature, since it uses the Visual Studio assemblies for operations with servers.
This does mean you&#8217;ll need access to those assemblies, which means you need to install a recent version of Visual Studio (any edition since version 2010, including Express since version 2012), or the Visual Studio SDK.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git-tf (whose home is at <a href="https://gittf.codeplex.com" class="bare">https://gittf.codeplex.com</a>) is a Java project, and as such runs on any computer with a Java runtime environment.
It interfaces with Git repositories through JGit (a JVM implementation of Git), which means it has virtually no limitations in terms of Git functions.
However, its support for TFVC is limited as compared to git-tfs – it does not support branches, for instance.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>So each tool has pros and cons, and there are plenty of situations that favor one over the other.
We&#8217;ll cover the basic usage of both of them in this book.</p>
</div>

<tr>

<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll need access to a TFVC-based repository to follow along with these instructions.
These aren&#8217;t as plentiful in the wild as Git or Subversion repositories, so you may need to create one of your own.
Codeplex (<a href="https://www.codeplex.com" class="bare">https://www.codeplex.com</a>) or Visual Studio Online (<a href="http://www.visualstudio.com" class="bare">http://www.visualstudio.com</a>) are both good choices for this.</p>

<h5 id="_getting_started_code_git_tf_code">Getting Started: <code>git-tf</code></h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing you do, just as with any Git project, is clone.
Here&#8217;s what that looks like with <code>git-tf</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git tf clone https://tfs.codeplex.com:443/tfs/TFS13 $/myproject/Main project_git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first argument is the URL of a TFVC collection, the second is of the form <code>$/project/branch</code>, and the third is the path to the local Git repository that is to be created (this last one is optional).
Git-tf can only work with one branch at a time; if you want to make checkins on a different TFVC branch, you&#8217;ll have to make a new clone from that branch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This creates a fully functional Git repository:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd project_git

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is called a <em>shallow</em> clone, meaning that only the latest changeset has been downloaded.
TFVC isn&#8217;t designed for each client to have a full copy of the history, so git-tf defaults to only getting the latest version, which is much faster.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have some time, it&#8217;s probably worth it to clone the entire project history, using the <code>--deep</code> option:</p>

<div class="listingblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice the tags with names like <code>TFS_C35189</code>; this is a feature that helps you know which Git commits are associated with TFVC changesets.
This is a nice way to represent it, since you can see with a simple log command which of your commits is associated with a snapshot that also exists in TFVC.
They aren&#8217;t necessary (and in fact you can turn them off with <code>git config git-tf.tag false</code>) – git-tf keeps the real commit-changeset mappings in the <code>.git/git-tf</code> file.</p>

    Hello

    git-tfs-id: [https://username.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection]$/myproject/Trunk;C16</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are two local branches, <code>master</code> and <code>featureA</code>, which represent the initial starting point of the clone (<code>Trunk</code> in TFVC) and a child branch (<code>featureA</code> in TFVC).
You can also see that the <code>tfs</code> &#8220;remote&#8221; has a couple of refs too: <code>default</code> and <code>featureA</code>, which represent TFVC branches.
Git-tfs maps the branch you cloned from to <code>tfs/default</code>, and others get their own names.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another thing to notice is the <code>git-tfs-id:</code> lines in the commit messages.
Instead of tags, git-tfs uses these markers to relate TFVC changesets to Git commits.
This has the implication that your Git commits will have a different SHA-1 hash before and after they have been pushed to TFVC.</p>

<p>The obvious next thing you&#8217;re going to want to do is work on the project.
TFVC and TFS have several features that may add complexity to your workflow:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Feature branches that aren&#8217;t represented in TFVC add a bit of complexity.
This has to do with the <strong>very</strong> different ways that TFVC and Git represent branches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Be aware that TFVC allows users to &#8220;checkout&#8221; files from the server, locking them so nobody else can edit them.
This obviously won&#8217;t stop you from editing them in your local repository, but it could get in the way when it comes time to push your changes up to the TFVC server.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>TFS has the concept of &#8220;gated&#8221; checkins, where a TFS build-test cycle has to complete successfully before the checkin is allowed.
This uses the &#8220;shelve&#8221; function in TFVC, which we don&#8217;t cover in detail here.
  You can fake this in a manual fashion with git-tf, and git-tfs provides the <code>checkintool</code> command which is gate-aware.</p>
</li>
</ol>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the interest of brevity, what we&#8217;ll cover here is the happy path, which sidesteps or avoids most of these issues.</p>

<p>Looks like someone else is working, too, and now we have divergent history.
This is where Git shines, but we have two choices of how to proceed:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p>Making a merge commit feels natural as a Git user (after all, that&#8217;s what <code>git pull</code> does), and git-tf can do this for you with a simple <code>git tf pull</code>.
Be aware, however, that TFVC doesn&#8217;t think this way, and if you push merge commits your history will start to look different on both sides, which can be confusing.
However, if you plan on submitting all of your changes as one changeset, this is probably the easiest choice.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Rebasing makes our commit history linear, which means we have the option of converting each of our Git commits into a TFVC changeset.
Since this leaves the most options open, we recommend you do it this way; git-tf even makes it easy for you with <code>git tf pull --rebase</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The choice is yours.
For this example, we&#8217;ll be rebasing:</p>

<p>Now we&#8217;re ready to make a checkin to the TFVC server.
Git-tf gives you the choice of making a single changeset that represents all the changes since the last one (<code>--shallow</code>, which is the default) and creating a new changeset for each Git commit (<code>--deep</code>).
For this example, we&#8217;ll just create one changeset:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s a new <code>TFS_C35348</code> tag, indicating that TFVC is storing the exact same snapshot as the <code>5a0e25e</code> commit.
It&#8217;s important to note that not every Git commit needs to have an exact counterpart in TFVC; the <code>6eb3eb5</code> commit, for example, doesn&#8217;t exist anywhere on the server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s the main workflow.
There are a couple of other considerations you&#8217;ll want to keep in mind:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>There is no branching.
Git-tf can only create Git repositories from one TFVC branch at a time.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Collaborate using either TFVC or Git, but not both.
Different git-tf clones of the same TFVC repository may have different commit SHA-1 hashes, which will cause no end of headaches.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If your team&#8217;s workflow includes collaborating in Git and syncing periodically with TFVC, only connect to TFVC with one of the Git repositories.</p>

<p>Notice how after every successful checkin to the TFVC server, git-tfs is rebasing the remaining work onto what it just did.
That&#8217;s because it&#8217;s adding the <code>git-tfs-id</code> field to the bottom of the commit messages, which changes the SHA-1 hashes.
This is exactly as designed, and there&#8217;s nothing to worry about, but you should be aware that it&#8217;s happening, especially if you&#8217;re sharing Git commits with others.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>TFS has many features that integrate with its version control system, such as work items, designated reviewers, gated checkins, and so on.
It can be cumbersome to work with these features using only a command-line tool, but fortunately git-tfs lets you launch a graphical checkin tool very easily:</p>

<p>Git-tfs also lets you control TFVC branches from your Git repository.

<p>Creating a branch in TFVC means adding a changeset where that branch now exists, and this is projected as a Git commit.
Note also that git-tfs <strong>created</strong> the <code>tfs/featureBee</code> remote branch, but <code>HEAD</code> is still pointing to <code>master</code>.
If you want to work on the newly-minted branch, you&#8217;ll want to base your new commits on the <code>1d54865</code> commit, perhaps by creating a topic branch from that commit.</p>

<h5 id="_git_and_tfs_summary">Git and TFS Summary</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git-tf and Git-tfs are both great tools for interfacing with a TFVC server.
They allow you to use the power of Git locally, avoid constantly having to round-trip to the central TFVC server, and make your life as a developer much easier, without forcing your entire team to migrate to Git.
If you&#8217;re working on Windows (which is likely if your team is using TFS), you&#8217;ll probably want to use git-tfs, since its feature set is more complete, but if you&#8217;re working on another platform, you&#8217;ll be using git-tf, which is more limited.
As with most of the tools in this chapter, you should choose one of these version-control systems to be canonical, and use the other one in a subordinate fashion – either Git or TFVC should be the center of collaboration, but not both.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_migrating">Migrating to Git</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If you have an existing codebase in another VCS but you&#8217;ve decided to start using Git, you must migrate your project one way or another.
This section goes over some importers for common systems, and then demonstrates how to develop your own custom importer.
You&#8217;ll learn how to import data from several of the bigger professionally used SCM systems, because they make up the majority of users who are switching, and because high-quality tools for them are easy to come by.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_subversion">Subversion</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

If you read the previous section about using <code>git svn</code>, you can easily use those instructions to <code>git svn clone</code> a repository; then, stop using the Subversion server, push to a new Git server, and start using that.
If you want the history, you can accomplish that as quickly as you can pull the data out of the Subversion server (which may take a while).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, the import isn&#8217;t perfect; and because it will take so long, you may as well do it right.
The first problem is the author information.
In Subversion, each person committing has a user on the system who is recorded in the commit information.
The examples in the previous section show <code>schacon</code> in some places, such as the <code>blame</code> output and the <code>git svn log</code>.
If you want to map this to better Git author data, you need a mapping from the Subversion users to the Git authors.
Create a file called <code>users.txt</code> that has this mapping in a format like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>schacon = Scott Chacon &lt;schacon@geemail.com&gt;
selse = Someo Nelse &lt;selse@geemail.com&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get a list of the author names that SVN uses, you can run this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ svn log --xml --quiet | grep author | sort -u | \
  perl -pe 's/.*&gt;(.*?)&lt;.*/$1 = /'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That generates the log output in XML format, then keeps only the lines with author information, discards duplicates, strips out the XML tags.
(Obviously this only works on a machine with <code>grep</code>, <code>sort</code>, and <code>perl</code> installed.)
Then, redirect that output into your <code>users.txt</code> file so you can add the equivalent Git user data next to each entry.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can provide this file to <code>git svn</code> to help it map the author data more accurately.
You can also tell <code>git svn</code> not to include the metadata that Subversion normally imports, by passing <code>--no-metadata</code> to the <code>clone</code> or <code>init</code> command (though if you want to keep the synchronisation-metadata, feel free to omit this parameter).
This makes your <code>import</code> command look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git svn clone http://my-project.googlecode.com/svn/ \
      --authors-file=users.txt --no-metadata --prefix "" -s my_project
$ cd my_project</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you should have a nicer Subversion import in your <code>my_project</code> directory.
Instead of commits that look like this</p>

<p>Not only does the Author field look a lot better, but the <code>git-svn-id</code> is no longer there, either.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should also do a bit of post-import cleanup.
For one thing, you should clean up the weird references that <code>git svn</code> set up.
First you&#8217;ll move the tags so they&#8217;re actual tags rather than strange remote branches, and then you&#8217;ll move the rest of the branches so they&#8217;re local.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To move the tags to be proper Git tags, run:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ for t in $(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/remotes/tags); do git tag ${t/tags\//} $t &amp;&amp; git branch -D -r $t; done</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This takes the references that were remote branches that started with <code>refs/remotes/tags/</code> and makes them real (lightweight) tags.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, move the rest of the references under <code>refs/remotes</code> to be local branches:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ for b in $(git for-each-ref --format='%(refname:short)' refs/remotes); do git branch $b refs/remotes/$b &amp;&amp; git branch -D -r $b; done</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It may happen that you&#8217;ll see some extra branches which are suffixed by <code>@xxx</code> (where xxx is a number), while in Subversion you only see one branch.
This is actually a Subversion feature called &#8220;peg-revisions&#8221;, which is something that Git simply has no syntactical counterpart for.
Hence, <code>git svn</code> simply adds the svn version number to the branch name just in the same way as you would have written it in svn to address the peg-revision of that branch.
If you do not care anymore about the peg-revisions, simply remove them:</p>

<p>Now all the old branches are real Git branches and all the old tags are real Git tags.</p>

<p>There&#8217;s one last thing to clean up.
Unfortunately, <code>git svn</code> creates an extra branch named <code>trunk</code>, which maps to Subversion&#8217;s default branch, but the <code>trunk</code> ref points to the same place as <code>master</code>.
Since <code>master</code> is more idiomatically Git, here&#8217;s how to remove the extra branch:</p>

<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git branch -d trunk</code></pre>

<p>The last thing to do is add your new Git server as a remote and push to it.
Here is an example of adding your server as a remote:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git remote add origin git@my-git-server:myrepository.git</code></pre>

<p>Because you want all your branches and tags to go up, you can now run this:</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git push origin --all
$ git push origin --tags</code></pre>

<p>All your branches and tags should be on your new Git server in a nice, clean import.</p>

<h4 id="_mercurial">Mercurial</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Since Mercurial and Git have fairly similar models for representing versions, and since Git is a bit more flexible, converting a repository from Mercurial to Git is fairly straightforward, using a tool called "hg-fast-export", which you&#8217;ll need a copy of:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone http://repo.or.cz/r/fast-export.git /tmp/fast-export</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first step in the conversion is to get a full clone of the Mercurial repository you want to convert:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ hg clone &lt;remote repo URL&gt; /tmp/hg-repo</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next step is to create an author mapping file.
Mercurial is a bit more forgiving than Git for what it will put in the author field for changesets, so this is a good time to clean house.
Generating this is a one-line command in a <code>bash</code> shell:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd /tmp/hg-repo
$ hg log | grep user: | sort | uniq | sed 's/user: *//' &gt; ../authors</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This will take a few seconds, depending on how long your project&#8217;s history is, and afterwards the <code>/tmp/authors</code> file will look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>bob
bob@localhost
bob &lt;bob@company.com&gt;
bob jones &lt;bob &lt;AT&gt; company &lt;DOT&gt; com&gt;
Bob Jones &lt;bob@company.com&gt;
Joe Smith &lt;joe@company.com&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this example, the same person (Bob) has created changesets under four different names, one of which actually looks correct, and one of which would be completely invalid for a Git commit.
Hg-fast-export lets us fix this by adding <code>={new name and email address}</code> at the end of every line we want to change, and removing the lines for any usernames that we want to leave alone.
If all the usernames look fine, we won&#8217;t need this file at all.
In this example, we want our file to look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>bob=Bob Jones &lt;bob@company.com&gt;
bob@localhost=Bob Jones &lt;bob@company.com&gt;
bob &lt;bob@company.com&gt;=Bob Jones &lt;bob@company.com&gt;
bob jones &lt;bob &lt;AT&gt; company &lt;DOT&gt; com&gt;=Bob Jones &lt;bob@company.com&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next step is to create our new Git repository, and run the export script:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git init /tmp/converted
$ cd /tmp/converted
$ /tmp/fast-export/hg-fast-export.sh -r /tmp/hg-repo -A /tmp/authors</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>-r</code> flag tells hg-fast-export where to find the Mercurial repository we want to convert, and the <code>-A</code> flag tells it where to find the author-mapping file.
The script parses Mercurial changesets and converts them into a script for Git&#8217;s "fast-import" feature (which we&#8217;ll discuss in detail a bit later on).
This takes a bit (though it&#8217;s <em>much</em> faster than it would be over the network), and the output is fairly verbose:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

<h4 id="_bazaar">Bazaar</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p></p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Bazaar is a DVCS tool much like Git, and as a result it&#8217;s pretty straightforward to convert a Bazaar repository into a Git one.
To accomplish this, you&#8217;ll need to import the <code>bzr-fastimport</code> plugin.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_getting_the_bzr_fastimport_plugin">Getting the bzr-fastimport plugin</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The procedure for installing the fastimport plugin is different on UNIX-like operating systems and on Windows.
In the first case, the simplest is to install the <code>bzr-fastimport</code> package that will install all the required dependencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, with Debian and derived, you would do the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo apt-get install bzr-fastimport</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With RHEL, you would do the following:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo yum install bzr-fastimport</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>With Fedora, since release 22, the new package manager is dnf:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ sudo dnf install bzr-fastimport</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the package is not available, you may install it as a plugin:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ mkdir --parents ~/.bazaar/plugins/bzr     # creates the necessary folders for the plugins
$ cd ~/.bazaar/plugins/bzr
$ bzr branch lp:bzr-fastimport fastimport   # imports the fastimport plugin
$ cd fastimport
$ sudo python setup.py install --record=files.txt   # installs the plugin</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For this plugin to work, you&#8217;ll also need the <code>fastimport</code> Python module.
You can check whether it is present or not and install it with the following commands:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ python -c "import fastimport"
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "&lt;string&gt;", line 1, in &lt;module&gt;
ImportError: No module named fastimport
$ pip install fastimport</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If it is not available, you can download it at address <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fastimport/" class="bare">https://pypi.python.org/pypi/fastimport/</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the second case (on Windows), <code>bzr-fastimport</code> is automatically installed with the standalone version and the default installation (let all the checkboxes checked).
So in this case you have nothing to do.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, the way to import a Bazaar repository differs according to that you have a single branch or you are working with a repository that has several branches.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_project_with_a_single_branch">Project with a single branch</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now <code>cd</code> in the directory that contains your Bazaar repository and initialize the Git repository:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cd /path/to/the/bzr/repository
$ git init</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, you can simply export your Bazaar repository and convert it into a Git repository using the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ bzr fast-export --plain . | git fast-import</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Depending on the size of the project, your Git repository is built in a lapse from a few seconds to a few minutes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_case_of_a_project_with_a_main_branch_and_a_working_branch">Case of a project with a main branch and a working branch</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also import a Bazaar repository that contains branches.
Let us suppose that you have two branches: one represents the main branch (myProject.trunk), the other one is the working branch (myProject.work).</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ ls
myProject.trunk myProject.work</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Create the Git repository and <code>cd</code> into it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git init git-repo
$ cd git-repo</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Pull the master branch into git:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ bzr fast-export --export-marks=../marks.bzr ../myProject.trunk | \

git fast-import --import-marks=../marks.git --export-marks=../marks.git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now <code>git branch</code> shows you the <code>master</code> branch as well as the <code>work</code> branch.
Check the logs to make sure they’re complete and get rid of the <code>marks.bzr</code> and <code>marks.git</code> files.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_synchronizing_the_staging_area">Synchronizing the staging area</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Whatever the number of branches you had and the import method you used, your staging area is not synchronized with <code>HEAD</code>, and with the import of several branches, your working directory is not synchronized either.
This situation is easily solved by the following command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git reset --hard HEAD</code></pre>

<h5 id="_ignoring_the_files_that_were_ignored_with_bzrignore">Ignoring the files that were ignored with .bzrignore</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now let&#8217;s have a look at the files to ignore.
As <code>.bzrignore</code>'s format is completely compatible with <code>.gitignore</code>'s format, the simplest is to rename your <code>.bzrignore</code> file.
You will also have to create a commit that contains this change for the migration:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git mv .bzrignore .gitignore

<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_sending_your_repository_to_the_server">Sending your repository to the server</h5>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_perforce_import">Perforce</h4>
<div class="paragraph">

The next system you&#8217;ll look at importing from is Perforce.
As we discussed above, there are two ways to let Git and Perforce talk to each other: git-p4 and Perforce Git Fusion.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_perforce_git_fusion">Perforce Git Fusion</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git Fusion makes this process fairly painless.
Just configure your project settings, user mappings, and branches using a configuration file (as discussed in <a href="#_p4_git_fusion">Git Fusion</a>), and clone the repository.
Git Fusion leaves you with what looks like a native Git repository, which is then ready to push to a native Git host if you desire.
You could even use Perforce as your Git host if you like.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_git_p4">Git-p4</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git-p4 can also act as an import tool.
As an example, we&#8217;ll import the Jam project from the Perforce Public Depot.
To set up your client, you must export the P4PORT environment variable to point to the Perforce depot:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>cut</code> command keeps only the characters between 11 and 20 from each line.
The <code>tail</code> command skips the first two lines, which are field headers and ASCII-art underlines.
The result of all of this is piped to <code>sort</code> and <code>uniq</code> to eliminate duplicates, and saved to a file named <code>AUTHORS</code>.
The next step is manual; in order for git-tfs to make effective use of this file, each line must be in this format:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-text" data-lang="text">DOMAIN\username = User Name &lt;email@address.com&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The portion on the left is the &#8220;User&#8221; field from TFVC, and the portion on the right side of the equals sign is the user name that will be used for Git commits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have this file, the next thing to do is make a full clone of the TFVC project you&#8217;re interested in:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell">PS&gt; git tfs clone --with-branches --authors=AUTHORS https://username.visualstudio.com/DefaultCollection $/project/Trunk project_git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next you&#8217;ll want to clean the <code>git-tfs-id</code> sections from the bottom of the commit messages.
The following command will do that:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-powershell" data-lang="powershell">PS&gt; git filter-branch -f --msg-filter 'sed "s/^git-tfs-id:.*$//g"' '--' --all</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That uses the <code>sed</code> command from the Git-bash environment to replace any line starting with &#8220;git-tfs-id:&#8221; with emptiness, which Git will then ignore.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once that&#8217;s all done, you&#8217;re ready to add a new remote, push all your branches up, and have your team start working from Git.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_custom_importer">A Custom Importer</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>

If your system isn&#8217;t one of the above, you should look for an importer online – quality importers are available for many other systems, including CVS, Clear Case, Visual Source Safe, even a directory of archives.
If none of these tools works for you, you have a more obscure tool, or you otherwise need a more custom importing process, you should use <code>git fast-import</code>.
This command reads simple instructions from stdin to write specific Git data.
It&#8217;s much easier to create Git objects this way than to run the raw Git commands or try to write the raw objects (see <a href="#_git_internals">Git Internals</a> for more information).
This way, you can write an import script that reads the necessary information out of the system you&#8217;re importing from and prints straightforward instructions to stdout.
You can then run this program and pipe its output through <code>git fast-import</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To quickly demonstrate, you&#8217;ll write a simple importer.
Suppose you work in <code>current</code>, you back up your project by occasionally copying the directory into a time-stamped <code>back_YYYY_MM_DD</code> backup directory, and you want to import this into Git.
Your directory structure looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ ls /opt/import_from
back_2014_01_02
back_2014_01_04
back_2014_01_14
back_2014_02_03
current</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In order to import a Git directory, you need to review how Git stores its data.
As you may remember, Git is fundamentally a linked list of commit objects that point to a snapshot of content.
All you have to do is tell <code>fast-import</code> what the content snapshots are, what commit data points to them, and the order they go in.
Your strategy will be to go through the snapshots one at a time and create commits with the contents of each directory, linking each commit back to the previous one.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As we did in <a href="#_an_example_git_enforced_policy">An Example Git-Enforced Policy</a>, we&#8217;ll write this in Ruby, because it&#8217;s what we generally work with and it tends to be easy to read.
You can write this example pretty easily in anything you&#8217;re familiar with – it just needs to print the appropriate information to <code>stdout</code>.
And, if you are running on Windows, this means you&#8217;ll need to take special care to not introduce carriage returns at the end your lines – <code>git fast-import</code> is very particular about just wanting line feeds (LF) not the carriage return line feeds (CRLF) that Windows uses.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To begin, you&#8217;ll change into the target directory and identify every subdirectory, each of which is a snapshot that you want to import as a commit.
You&#8217;ll change into each subdirectory and print the commands necessary to export it.
Your basic main loop looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">last_mark = nil

# loop through the directories
Dir.chdir(ARGV[0]) do
  Dir.glob("*").each do |dir|
    next if File.file?(dir)

    # move into the target directory
    Dir.chdir(dir) do
      last_mark = print_export(dir, last_mark)
    end
  end
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You run <code>print_export</code> inside each directory, which takes the manifest and mark of the previous snapshot and returns the manifest and mark of this one; that way, you can link them properly.
&#8220;Mark&#8221; is the <code>fast-import</code> term for an identifier you give to a commit; as you create commits, you give each one a mark that you can use to link to it from other commits.
So, the first thing to do in your <code>print_export</code> method is generate a mark from the directory name:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">mark = convert_dir_to_mark(dir)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll do this by creating an array of directories and using the index value as the mark, because a mark must be an integer.
Your method looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">$marks = []
def convert_dir_to_mark(dir)
  if !$marks.include?(dir)
    $marks &lt;&lt; dir
  end
  ($marks.index(dir) + 1).to_s
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you have an integer representation of your commit, you need a date for the commit metadata.
Because the date is expressed in the name of the directory, you&#8217;ll parse it out.
The next line in your <code>print_export</code> file is:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">date = convert_dir_to_date(dir)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>where <code>convert_dir_to_date</code> is defined as:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">def convert_dir_to_date(dir)
  if dir == 'current'
    return Time.now().to_i
  else
    dir = dir.gsub('back_', '')
    (year, month, day) = dir.split('_')
    return Time.local(year, month, day).to_i
  end
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That returns an integer value for the date of each directory.
The last piece of meta-information you need for each commit is the committer data, which you hardcode in a global variable:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">$author = 'John Doe &lt;john@example.com&gt;'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you&#8217;re ready to begin printing out the commit data for your importer.
The initial information states that you&#8217;re defining a commit object and what branch it&#8217;s on, followed by the mark you&#8217;ve generated, the committer information and commit message, and then the previous commit, if any.
The code looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"># print the import information
puts 'commit refs/heads/master'
puts 'mark :' + mark
puts "committer #{$author} #{date} -0700"
export_data('imported from ' + dir)
puts 'from :' + last_mark if last_mark</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You hardcode the time zone (-0700) because doing so is easy.
If you&#8217;re importing from another system, you must specify the time zone as an offset.
The commit message must be expressed in a special format:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>data (size)\n(contents)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The format consists of the word data, the size of the data to be read, a newline, and finally the data.
Because you need to use the same format to specify the file contents later, you create a helper method, <code>export_data</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">def export_data(string)
  print "data #{string.size}\n#{string}"
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>All that&#8217;s left is to specify the file contents for each snapshot.
This is easy, because you have each one in a directory – you can print out the <code>deleteall</code> command followed by the contents of each file in the directory.
Git will then record each snapshot appropriately:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">puts 'deleteall'
Dir.glob("**/*").each do |file|
  next if !File.file?(file)
  inline_data(file)
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Note:  Because many systems think of their revisions as changes from one commit to another, fast-import can also take commands with each commit to specify which files have been added, removed, or modified and what the new contents are.
You could calculate the differences between snapshots and provide only this data, but doing so is more complex – you may as well give Git all the data and let it figure it out.
If this is better suited to your data, check the <code>fast-import</code> man page for details about how to provide your data in this manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The format for listing the new file contents or specifying a modified file with the new contents is as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>M 644 inline path/to/file
data (size)
(file contents)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here, 644 is the mode (if you have executable files, you need to detect and specify 755 instead), and inline says you&#8217;ll list the contents immediately after this line.
Your <code>inline_data</code> method looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">def inline_data(file, code = 'M', mode = '644')
  content = File.read(file)
  puts "#{code} #{mode} inline #{file}"
  export_data(content)
end</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You reuse the <code>export_data</code> method you defined earlier, because it&#8217;s the same as the way you specified your commit message data.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last thing you need to do is to return the current mark so it can be passed to the next iteration:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby">return mark</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">

<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you are running on Windows you&#8217;ll need to make sure that you add one extra step.
As mentioned before, Windows uses CRLF for new line characters while <code>git fast-import</code> expects only LF.
To get around this problem and make <code>git fast-import</code> happy, you need to tell ruby to use LF instead of CRLF:</p>

<h3 id="_summary_12">Summary</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should feel comfortable using Git as a client for other version-control systems, or importing nearly any existing repository into Git without losing data.
In the next chapter, we&#8217;ll cover the raw internals of Git so you can craft every single byte, if need be.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_git_internals">Git Internals</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may have skipped to this chapter from a previous chapter, or you may have gotten here after reading the rest of the book – in either case, this is where we&#8217;ll go over the inner workings and implementation of Git.
We found that learning this information was fundamentally important to understanding how useful and powerful Git is, but others have argued to us that it can be confusing and unnecessarily complex for beginners.
Thus, we&#8217;ve made this discussion the last chapter in the book so you could read it early or later in your learning process.
We leave it up to you to decide.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you&#8217;re here, let&#8217;s get started.
First, if it isn&#8217;t yet clear, Git is fundamentally a content-addressable filesystem with a VCS user interface written on top of it.
You&#8217;ll learn more about what this means in a bit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the early days of Git (mostly pre 1.5), the user interface was much more complex because it emphasized this filesystem rather than a polished VCS.
In the last few years, the UI has been refined until it&#8217;s as clean and easy to use as any system out there; but often, the stereotype lingers about the early Git UI that was complex and difficult to learn.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The content-addressable filesystem layer is amazingly cool, so we&#8217;ll cover that first in this chapter; then, you&#8217;ll learn about the transport mechanisms and the repository maintenance tasks that you may eventually have to deal with.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_plumbing_porcelain">Plumbing and Porcelain</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This book covers how to use Git with 30 or so verbs such as <code>checkout</code>, <code>branch</code>, <code>remote</code>, and so on.
But because Git was initially a toolkit for a VCS rather than a full user-friendly VCS, it has a bunch of verbs that do low-level work and were designed to be chained together UNIX style or called from scripts.
These commands are generally referred to as &#8220;plumbing&#8221; commands, and the more user-friendly commands are called &#8220;porcelain&#8221; commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The book&#8217;s first nine chapters deal almost exclusively with porcelain commands.
But in this chapter, you&#8217;ll be dealing mostly with the lower-level plumbing commands, because they give you access to the inner workings of Git, and help demonstrate how and why Git does what it does.
Many of these commands aren&#8217;t meant to be used manually on the command line, but rather to be used as building blocks for new tools and custom scripts.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you run <code>git init</code> in a new or existing directory, Git creates the <code>.git</code> directory, which is where almost everything that Git stores and manipulates is located.
If you want to back up or clone your repository, copying this single directory elsewhere gives you nearly everything you need.
This entire chapter basically deals with the stuff in this directory.
Here&#8217;s what it looks like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ ls -F1
HEAD
config*
description
hooks/
info/
objects/
refs/</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You may see some other files in there, but this is a fresh <code>git init</code> repository – it&#8217;s what you see by default.
The <code>description</code> file is only used by the GitWeb program, so don&#8217;t worry about it.
The <code>config</code> file contains your project-specific configuration options, and the <code>info</code> directory keeps a global exclude file  for ignored patterns that you don&#8217;t want to track in a .gitignore file.
The <code>hooks</code> directory contains your client- or server-side hook scripts, which are discussed in detail in <a href="#_git_hooks">Git Hooks</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This leaves four important entries: the <code>HEAD</code> and (yet to be created) <code>index</code> files, and the <code>objects</code> and <code>refs</code> directories.
These are the core parts of Git.
The <code>objects</code> directory stores all the content for your database, the <code>refs</code> directory stores pointers into commit objects in that data (branches), the <code>HEAD</code> file points to the branch you currently have checked out, and the <code>index</code> file is where Git stores your staging area information.
You&#8217;ll now look at each of these sections in detail to see how Git operates.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git is a content-addressable filesystem.
Great.
What does that mean?
It means that at the core of Git is a simple key-value data store.
You can insert any kind of content into it, and it will give you back a key that you can use to retrieve the content again at any time.
To demonstrate, you can use the plumbing command <code>hash-object</code>, which takes some data, stores it in your <code>.git</code> directory, and gives you back the key the data is stored as.
First, you initialize a new Git repository and verify that there is nothing in the <code>objects</code> directory:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git init test
Initialized empty Git repository in /tmp/test/.git/
$ cd test
$ find .git/objects
.git/objects
.git/objects/info
.git/objects/pack
$ find .git/objects -type f</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git has initialized the <code>objects</code> directory and created <code>pack</code> and <code>info</code> subdirectories in it, but there are no regular files.
Now, store some text in your Git database:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ echo 'test content' | git hash-object -w --stdin
d670460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>-w</code> tells <code>hash-object</code> to store the object; otherwise, the command simply tells you what the key would be.
<code>--stdin</code> tells the command to read the content from stdin; if you don&#8217;t specify this, <code>hash-object</code> expects a file path at the end.
The output from the command is a 40-character checksum hash.
This is the SHA-1 hash – a checksum of the content you&#8217;re storing plus a header, which you&#8217;ll learn about in a bit.
Now you can see how Git has stored your data:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ find .git/objects -type f
.git/objects/d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can see a file in the <code>objects</code> directory.
This is how Git stores the content initially – as a single file per piece of content, named with the SHA-1 checksum of the content and its header.
The subdirectory is named with the first 2 characters of the SHA-1, and the filename is the remaining 38 characters.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can pull the content back out of Git with the <code>cat-file</code> command.
This command is sort of a Swiss army knife for inspecting Git objects.
Passing <code>-p</code> to it instructs the <code>cat-file</code> command to figure out the type of content and display it nicely for you:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git cat-file -p d670460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4
test content</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, you can add content to Git and pull it back out again.
You can also do this with content in files.
For example, you can do some simple version control on a file.
First, create a new file and save its contents in your database:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ echo 'version 1' &gt; test.txt
$ git hash-object -w test.txt
83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, write some new content to the file, and save it again:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ echo 'version 2' &gt; test.txt
$ git hash-object -w test.txt
1f7a7a472abf3dd9643fd615f6da379c4acb3e3a</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your database contains the two new versions of the file as well as the first content you stored there:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ find .git/objects -type f
.git/objects/1f/7a7a472abf3dd9643fd615f6da379c4acb3e3a

.git/objects/d6/70460b4b4aece5915caf5c68d12f560a9fe3e4</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you can revert the file back to the first version</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git cat-file -p 83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30 &gt; test.txt
$ cat test.txt
version 1</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>or the second version:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git cat-file -p 1f7a7a472abf3dd9643fd615f6da379c4acb3e3a &gt; test.txt
$ cat test.txt
version 2</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But remembering the SHA-1 key for each version of your file isn&#8217;t practical; plus, you aren&#8217;t storing the filename in your system – just the content.
This object type is called a blob.
You can have Git tell you the object type of any object in Git, given its SHA-1 key, with <code>cat-file -t</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git cat-file -t 1f7a7a472abf3dd9643fd615f6da379c4acb3e3a

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_tree_objects">Tree Objects</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next type we&#8217;ll look at is the tree, which solves the problem of storing the filename and also allows you to store a group of files together.
Git stores content in a manner similar to a UNIX filesystem, but a bit simplified.
All the content is stored as tree and blob objects, with trees corresponding to UNIX directory entries and blobs corresponding more or less to inodes or file contents.
A single tree object contains one or more tree entries, each of which contains a SHA-1 pointer to a blob or subtree with its associated mode, type, and filename.
For example, the most recent tree in a project may look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git cat-file -p master^{tree}
100644 blob a906cb2a4a904a152e80877d4088654daad0c859      README

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>master^{tree}</code> syntax specifies the tree object that is pointed to by the last commit on your <code>master</code> branch.
Notice that the <code>lib</code> subdirectory isn&#8217;t a blob but a pointer to another tree:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git cat-file -p 99f1a6d12cb4b6f19c8655fca46c3ecf317074e0

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Conceptually, the data that Git is storing is something like this:</p>

<div class="title">Figure 149. Simple version of the Git data model.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can fairly easily create your own tree.
Git normally creates a tree by taking the state of your staging area or index and writing a series of tree objects from it.
So, to create a tree object, you first have to set up an index by staging some files.
To create an index with a single entry – the first version of your <code>test.txt</code> file – you can use the plumbing command <code>update-index</code>.
You use this command to artificially add the earlier version of the <code>test.txt</code> file to a new staging area.
You must pass it the <code>--add</code> option because the file doesn&#8217;t yet exist in your staging area (you don&#8217;t even have a staging area set up yet) and <code>--cacheinfo</code> because the file you&#8217;re adding isn&#8217;t in your directory but is in your database.
Then, you specify the mode, SHA-1, and filename:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git update-index --add --cacheinfo 100644 \
  83baae61804e65cc73a7201a7252750c76066a30 test.txt</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, you&#8217;re specifying a mode of <code>100644</code>, which means it&#8217;s a normal file.
Other options are <code>100755</code>, which means it&#8217;s an executable file; and <code>120000</code>, which specifies a symbolic link.
The mode is taken from normal UNIX modes but is much less flexible – these three modes are the only ones that are valid for files (blobs) in Git (although other modes are used for directories and submodules).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, you can use the <code>write-tree</code> command to write the staging area out to a tree object.
No <code>-w</code> option is needed – calling <code>write-tree</code> automatically creates a tree object from the state of the index if that tree doesn&#8217;t yet exist:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git write-tree

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ll now create a new tree with the second version of <code>test.txt</code> and a new file as well:</p>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your staging area now has the new version of <code>test.txt</code> as well as the new file <code>new.txt</code>.
Write out that tree (recording the state of the staging area or index to a tree object) and see what it looks like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that this tree has both file entries and also that the <code>test.txt</code> SHA-1 is the &#8220;version 2&#8221; SHA-1 from earlier (<code>1f7a7a</code>).
Just for fun, you&#8217;ll add the first tree as a subdirectory into this one.
You can read trees into your staging area by calling <code>read-tree</code>.
In this case, you can read an existing tree into your staging area as a subtree by using the <code>--prefix</code> option to <code>read-tree</code>:</p>

<p>If you created a working directory from the new tree you just wrote, you would get the two files in the top level of the working directory and a subdirectory named <code>bak</code> that contained the first version of the <code>test.txt</code> file.

<p>Amazing.
You&#8217;ve just done the low-level operations to build up a Git history without using any of the front end commands.
This is essentially what Git does when you run the <code>git add</code> and <code>git commit</code> commands – it stores blobs for the files that have changed, updates the index, writes out trees, and writes commit objects that reference the top-level trees and the commits that came immediately before them.
These three main Git objects – the blob, the tree, and the commit – are initially stored as separate files in your <code>.git/objects</code> directory.
Here are all the objects in the example directory now, commented with what they store:</p>

<h4 id="_object_storage">Object Storage</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We mentioned earlier that a header is stored with the content.
Let&#8217;s take a minute to look at how Git stores its objects.
You&#8217;ll see how to store a blob object – in this case, the string &#8220;what is up, doc?&#8221; – interactively in the Ruby scripting language.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can start up interactive Ruby mode with the <code>irb</code> command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ irb
&gt;&gt; content = "what is up, doc?"
=&gt; "what is up, doc?"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git constructs a header that starts with the type of the object, in this case a blob.
Then, it adds a space followed by the size of the content and finally a null byte:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">&gt;&gt; header = "blob #{content.length}\0"
=&gt; "blob 16\u0000"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git concatenates the header and the original content and then calculates the SHA-1 checksum of that new content.
You can calculate the SHA-1 value of a string in Ruby by including the SHA1 digest library with the <code>require</code> command and then calling <code>Digest::SHA1.hexdigest()</code> with the string:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">&gt;&gt; store = header + content
=&gt; "blob 16\u0000what is up, doc?"
&gt;&gt; require 'digest/sha1'
=&gt; true
&gt;&gt; sha1 = Digest::SHA1.hexdigest(store)
=&gt; "bd9dbf5aae1a3862dd1526723246b20206e5fc37"</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git compresses the new content with zlib, which you can do in Ruby with the zlib library.
First, you need to require the library and then run <code>Zlib::Deflate.deflate()</code> on the content:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">&gt;&gt; require 'zlib'
=&gt; true
&gt;&gt; zlib_content = Zlib::Deflate.deflate(store)

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, you&#8217;ll write your zlib-deflated content to an object on disk.
You&#8217;ll determine the path of the object you want to write out (the first two characters of the SHA-1 value being the subdirectory name, and the last 38 characters being the filename within that directory).
In Ruby, you can use the <code>FileUtils.mkdir_p()</code> function to create the subdirectory if it doesn&#8217;t exist.
Then, open the file with <code>File.open()</code> and write out the previously zlib-compressed content to the file with a <code>write()</code> call on the resulting file handle:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">&gt;&gt; path = '.git/objects/' + sha1[0,2] + '/' + sha1[2,38]

&gt;&gt; require 'fileutils'
=&gt; true
&gt;&gt; FileUtils.mkdir_p(File.dirname(path))
=&gt; ".git/objects/bd"
&gt;&gt; File.open(path, 'w') { |f| f.write zlib_content }
=&gt; 32</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s it – you&#8217;ve created a valid Git blob object.
All Git objects are stored the same way, just with different types – instead of the string blob, the header will begin with commit or tree.
Also, although the blob content can be nearly anything, the commit and tree content are very specifically formatted.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_git_refs">Git References</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can run something like <code>git log 1a410e</code> to look through your whole history, but you still have to remember that <code>1a410e</code> is the last commit in order to walk that history to find all those objects.
You need a file in which you can store the SHA-1 value under a simple name so you can use that pointer rather than the raw SHA-1 value.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In Git, these are called &#8220;references&#8221; or &#8220;refs&#8221;; you can find the files that contain the SHA-1 values in the <code>.git/refs</code> directory.
In the current project, this directory contains no files, but it does contain a simple structure:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ find .git/refs
.git/refs
.git/refs/heads
.git/refs/tags
$ find .git/refs -type f</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create a new reference that will help you remember where your latest commit is, you can technically do something as simple as this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ echo "1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9" &gt; .git/refs/heads/master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, you can use the head reference you just created instead of the SHA-1 value in your Git commands:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log --pretty=oneline master

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You aren&#8217;t encouraged to directly edit the reference files.
Git provides a safer command to do this if you want to update a reference called <code>update-ref</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git update-ref refs/heads/master 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9</code></pre>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s basically what a branch in Git is: a simple pointer or reference to the head of a line of work.

<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git update-ref refs/heads/test cac0ca</code></pre>

<div class="title">Figure 152. Git directory objects with branch head references included.</div>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you run commands like <code>git branch (branchname)</code>, Git basically runs that <code>update-ref</code> command to add the SHA-1 of the last commit of the branch you&#8217;re on into whatever new reference you want to create.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_head">The HEAD</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The question now is, when you run <code>git branch (branchname)</code>, how does Git know the SHA-1 of the last commit?
The answer is the HEAD file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The HEAD file is a symbolic reference to the branch you&#8217;re currently on.
By symbolic reference, we mean that unlike a normal reference, it doesn’t generally contain a SHA-1 value but rather a pointer to another reference.
If you look at the file, you&#8217;ll normally see something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you run <code>git checkout test</code>, Git updates the file to look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat .git/HEAD
ref: refs/heads/test</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>When you run <code>git commit</code>, it creates the commit object, specifying the parent of that commit object to be whatever SHA-1 value the reference in HEAD points to.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also manually edit this file, but again a safer command exists to do so: <code>symbolic-ref</code>.
You can read the value of your HEAD via this command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git symbolic-ref HEAD
refs/heads/master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also set the value of HEAD:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git symbolic-ref HEAD refs/heads/test
$ cat .git/HEAD

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can&#8217;t set a symbolic reference outside of the refs style:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git symbolic-ref HEAD test

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_tags">Tags</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We just finished discussing Git&#8217;s three main object types, but there is a fourth.
The tag object is very much like a commit object – it contains a tagger, a date, a message, and a pointer.
The main difference is that a tag object generally points to a commit rather than a tree.
It&#8217;s like a branch reference, but it never moves – it always points to the same commit but gives it a friendlier name.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>As discussed in <a href="#_git_basics_chapter">Git Basics</a>, there are two types of tags: annotated and lightweight.
You can make a lightweight tag by running something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git update-ref refs/tags/v1.0 cac0cab538b970a37ea1e769cbbde608743bc96d</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That is all a lightweight tag is – a reference that never moves.
An annotated tag is more complex, however.
If you create an annotated tag, Git creates a tag object and then writes a reference to point to it rather than directly to the commit.
You can see this by creating an annotated tag (<code>-a</code> specifies that it&#8217;s an annotated tag):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git tag -a v1.1 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9 -m 'test tag'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s the object SHA-1 value it created:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat .git/refs/tags/v1.1
9585191f37f7b0fb9444f35a9bf50de191beadc2</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, run the <code>cat-file</code> command on that SHA-1 value:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git cat-file -p 9585191f37f7b0fb9444f35a9bf50de191beadc2

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice that the object entry points to the commit SHA-1 value that you tagged.
Also notice that it doesn&#8217;t need to point to a commit; you can tag any Git object.
In the Git source code, for example, the maintainer has added their GPG public key as a blob object and then tagged it.
You can view the public key by running this in a clone of the Git repository:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git cat-file blob junio-gpg-pub</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Linux kernel repository also has a non-commit-pointing tag object – the first tag created points to the initial tree of the import of the source code.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_remotes">Remotes</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The third type of reference that you&#8217;ll see is a remote reference.
If you add a remote and push to it, Git stores the value you last pushed to that remote for each branch in the <code>refs/remotes</code> directory.
For instance, you can add a remote called <code>origin</code> and push your <code>master</code> branch to it:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git remote add origin git@github.com:schacon/simplegit-progit.git
$ git push origin master

  a11bef0..ca82a6d  master -&gt; master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Then, you can see what the <code>master</code> branch on the <code>origin</code> remote was the last time you communicated with the server, by checking the <code>refs/remotes/origin/master</code> file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat .git/refs/remotes/origin/master
ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Remote references differ from branches (<code>refs/heads</code> references) mainly in that they&#8217;re considered read-only.
You can <code>git checkout</code> to one, but Git won&#8217;t point HEAD at one, so you&#8217;ll never update it with a <code>commit</code> command.
Git manages them as bookmarks to the last known state of where those branches were on those servers.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_packfiles">Packfiles</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s go back to the objects database for your test Git repository.
At this point, you have 11 objects – 4 blobs, 3 trees, 3 commits, and 1 tag:</p>

<p>Git compresses the contents of these files with zlib, and you&#8217;re not storing much, so all these files collectively take up only 925 bytes.
You&#8217;ll add some larger content to the repository to demonstrate an interesting feature of Git.
To demonstrate, we&#8217;ll add the <code>repo.rb</code> file from the Grit library – this is about a 22K source code file:</p>

<p>The blob is now a different blob, which means that although you added only a single line to the end of a 400-line file, Git stored that new content as a completely new object:</p>

<p>You have two nearly identical 22K objects on your disk (each compressed to approximately 7K).
Wouldn&#8217;t it be nice if Git could store one of them in full but then the second object only as the delta between it and the first?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It turns out that it can.
The initial format in which Git saves objects on disk is called a &#8220;loose&#8221; object format.
However, occasionally Git packs up several of these objects into a single binary file called a &#8220;packfile&#8221; in order to save space and be more efficient.
Git does this if you have too many loose objects around, if you run the <code>git gc</code> command manually, or if you push to a remote server.
To see what happens, you can manually ask Git to pack up the objects by calling the <code>git gc</code> command:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git gc
Counting objects: 18, done.

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you look in your objects directory, you&#8217;ll find that most of your objects are gone, and a new pair of files has appeared:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ find .git/objects -type f

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The objects that remain are the blobs that aren&#8217;t pointed to by any commit – in this case, the &#8220;what is up, doc?&#8221; example and the &#8220;test content&#8221; example blobs you created earlier.
Because you never added them to any commits, they&#8217;re considered dangling and aren&#8217;t packed up in your new packfile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other files are your new packfile and an index.
The packfile is a single file containing the contents of all the objects that were removed from your filesystem.
The index is a file that contains offsets into that packfile so you can quickly seek to a specific object.
What is cool is that although the objects on disk before you ran the <code>gc</code> were collectively about 15K in size, the new packfile is only 7K.
You&#8217;ve cut your disk usage by half by packing your objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>How does Git do this?
When Git packs objects, it looks for files that are named and sized similarly, and stores just the deltas from one version of the file to the next.
You can look into the packfile and see what Git did to save space.
The <code>git verify-pack</code> plumbing command allows you to see what was packed up:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here, the <code>033b4</code> blob, which if you remember was the first version of your repo.rb file, is referencing the <code>b042a</code> blob, which was the second version of the file.
The third column in the output is the size of the object in the pack, so you can see that <code>b042a</code> takes up 22K of the file, but that <code>033b4</code> only takes up 9 bytes.
What is also interesting is that the second version of the file is the one that is stored intact, whereas the original version is stored as a delta – this is because you&#8217;re most likely to need faster access to the most recent version of the file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The really nice thing about this is that it can be repacked at any time.
Git will occasionally repack your database automatically, always trying to save more space, but you can also manually repack at any time by running <code>git gc</code> by hand.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_refspec">The Refspec</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Throughout this book, we&#8217;ve used simple mappings from remote branches to local references, but they can be more complex.
Suppose you add a remote like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git remote add origin https://github.com/schacon/simplegit-progit</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It adds a section to your <code>.git/config</code> file, specifying the name of the remote (<code>origin</code>), the URL of the remote repository, and the refspec for fetching:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/schacon/simplegit-progit
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The format of the refspec is an optional <code>+</code>, followed by <code>&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;</code>, where <code>&lt;src&gt;</code> is the pattern for references on the remote side and <code>&lt;dst&gt;</code> is where those references will be written locally.
The <code>+</code> tells Git to update the reference even if it isn&#8217;t a fast-forward.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In the default case that is automatically written by a <code>git remote add</code> command, Git fetches all the references under <code>refs/heads/</code> on the server and writes them to <code>refs/remotes/origin/</code> locally.
So, if there is a <code>master</code> branch on the server, you can access the log of that branch locally via</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log origin/master
$ git log remotes/origin/master
$ git log refs/remotes/origin/master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They&#8217;re all equivalent, because Git expands each of them to <code>refs/remotes/origin/master</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you want Git instead to pull down only the <code>master</code> branch each time, and not every other branch on the remote server, you can change the fetch line to</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is just the default refspec for <code>git fetch</code> for that remote.
If you want to do something one time, you can specify the refspec on the command line, too.
To pull the <code>master</code> branch on the remote down to <code>origin/mymaster</code> locally, you can run</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/mymaster</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also specify multiple refspecs.
On the command line, you can pull down several branches like so:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git fetch origin master:refs/remotes/origin/mymaster \
	 topic:refs/remotes/origin/topic
From git@github.com:schacon/simplegit
 ! [rejected]        master     -&gt; origin/mymaster  (non fast forward)
 * [new branch]      topic      -&gt; origin/topic</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, the <code>master</code> branch pull was rejected because it wasn&#8217;t a fast-forward reference.
You can override that by specifying the <code>+</code> in front of the refspec.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also specify multiple refspecs for fetching in your configuration file.
If you want to always fetch the <code>master</code> and <code>experiment</code> branches, add two lines:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/schacon/simplegit-progit
	fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master
	fetch = +refs/heads/experiment:refs/remotes/origin/experiment</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can&#8217;t use partial globs in the pattern, so this would be invalid:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">fetch = +refs/heads/qa*:refs/remotes/origin/qa*</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, you can use namespaces (or directories) to accomplish something like that.
If you have a QA team that pushes a series of branches, and you want to get the <code>master</code> branch and any of the QA team&#8217;s branches but nothing else, you can use a config section like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/schacon/simplegit-progit
	fetch = +refs/heads/master:refs/remotes/origin/master
	fetch = +refs/heads/qa/*:refs/remotes/origin/qa/*</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you have a complex workflow process that has a QA team pushing branches, developers pushing branches, and integration teams pushing and collaborating on remote branches, you can namespace them easily this way.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_pushing_refspecs">Pushing Refspecs</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s nice that you can fetch namespaced references that way, but how does the QA team get their branches into a <code>qa/</code> namespace in the first place?
You accomplish that by using refspecs to push.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the QA team wants to push their <code>master</code> branch to <code>qa/master</code> on the remote server, they can run</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git push origin master:refs/heads/qa/master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If they want Git to do that automatically each time they run <code>git push origin</code>, they can add a <code>push</code> value to their config file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-ini" data-lang="ini">[remote "origin"]
	url = https://github.com/schacon/simplegit-progit
	fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
	push = refs/heads/master:refs/heads/qa/master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, this will cause a <code>git push origin</code> to push the local <code>master</code> branch to the remote <code>qa/master</code> branch by default.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_deleting_references">Deleting References</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can also use the refspec to delete references from the remote server by running something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git push origin :topic</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the refspec is <code>&lt;src&gt;:&lt;dst&gt;</code>, by leaving off the <code>&lt;src&gt;</code> part, this basically says to make the <code>topic</code> branch on the remote nothing, which deletes it.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_transfer_protocols">Transfer Protocols</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git can transfer data between two repositories in two major ways: the &#8220;dumb&#8221; protocol and the &#8220;smart&#8221; protocol.
This section will quickly cover how these two main protocols operate.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_dumb_protocol">The Dumb Protocol</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re setting up a repository to be served read-only over HTTP, the dumb protocol is likely what will be used.
This protocol is called &#8220;dumb&#8221; because it requires no Git-specific code on the server side during the transport process; the fetch process is a series of HTTP <code>GET</code> requests, where the client can assume the layout of the Git repository on the server.</p>
</div>
<div class="admonitionblock note">
<table>
<tr>
<td class="icon">
<div class="title">Note</div>
</td>
<td class="content">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The dumb protocol is fairly rarely used these days.
It&#8217;s difficult to secure or make private, so most Git hosts (both cloud-based and on-premises) will refuse to use it.
It&#8217;s generally advised to use the smart protocol, which we describe a bit further on.</p>
</div>
</td>
</tr>
</table>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s follow the <code>http-fetch</code> process for the simplegit library:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git clone http://server/simplegit-progit.git</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first thing this command does is pull down the <code>info/refs</code> file.
This file is written by the <code>update-server-info</code> command, which is why you need to enable that as a <code>post-receive</code> hook in order for the HTTP transport to work properly:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>=&gt; GET info/refs
ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949     refs/heads/master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now you have a list of the remote references and SHA-1s.
Next, you look for what the HEAD reference is so you know what to check out when you&#8217;re finished:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>=&gt; GET HEAD
ref: refs/heads/master</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You need to check out the <code>master</code> branch when you&#8217;ve completed the process.
At this point, you&#8217;re ready to start the walking process.
Because your starting point is the <code>ca82a6</code> commit object you saw in the <code>info/refs</code> file, you start by fetching that:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>=&gt; GET objects/ca/82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949
(179 bytes of binary data)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You get an object back – that object is in loose format on the server, and you fetched it over a static HTTP GET request.
You can zlib-uncompress it, strip off the header, and look at the commit content:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git cat-file -p ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949

changed the version number</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, you have two more objects to retrieve – <code>cfda3b</code>, which is the tree of content that the commit we just retrieved points to; and <code>085bb3</code>, which is the parent commit:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>=&gt; GET objects/08/5bb3bcb608e1e8451d4b2432f8ecbe6306e7e7
(179 bytes of data)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That gives you your next commit object.
Grab the tree object:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>=&gt; GET objects/cf/da3bf379e4f8dba8717dee55aab78aef7f4daf
(404 - Not Found)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Oops – it looks like that tree object isn&#8217;t in loose format on the server, so you get a 404 response back.
There are a couple of reasons for this – the object could be in an alternate repository, or it could be in a packfile in this repository.
Git checks for any listed alternates first:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>=&gt; GET objects/info/http-alternates
(empty file)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If this comes back with a list of alternate URLs, Git checks for loose files and packfiles there – this is a nice mechanism for projects that are forks of one another to share objects on disk.
However, because no alternates are listed in this case, your object must be in a packfile.
To see what packfiles are available on this server, you need to get the <code>objects/info/packs</code> file, which contains a listing of them (also generated by <code>update-server-info</code>):</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>=&gt; GET objects/info/packs
P pack-816a9b2334da9953e530f27bcac22082a9f5b835.pack</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There is only one packfile on the server, so your object is obviously in there, but you&#8217;ll check the index file to make sure.
This is also useful if you have multiple packfiles on the server, so you can see which packfile contains the object you need:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>=&gt; GET objects/pack/pack-816a9b2334da9953e530f27bcac22082a9f5b835.idx
(4k of binary data)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that you have the packfile index, you can see if your object is in it – because the index lists the SHA-1s of the objects contained in the packfile and the offsets to those objects.
Your object is there, so go ahead and get the whole packfile:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>=&gt; GET objects/pack/pack-816a9b2334da9953e530f27bcac22082a9f5b835.pack
(13k of binary data)</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You have your tree object, so you continue walking your commits.
They&#8217;re all also within the packfile you just downloaded, so you don&#8217;t have to do any more requests to your server.
Git checks out a working copy of the <code>master</code> branch that was pointed to by the HEAD reference you downloaded at the beginning.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_the_smart_protocol">The Smart Protocol</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The dumb protocol is simple but a bit inefficient, and it can&#8217;t handle writing of data from the client to the server.
The smart protocol is a more common method of transferring data, but it requires a process on the remote end that is intelligent about Git – it can read local data, figure out what the client has and needs, and generate a custom packfile for it.
There are two sets of processes for transferring data: a pair for uploading data and a pair for downloading data.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_uploading_data">Uploading Data</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
To upload data to a remote process, Git uses the <code>send-pack</code> and <code>receive-pack</code> processes.
The <code>send-pack</code> process runs on the client and connects to a <code>receive-pack</code> process on the remote side.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_ssh">SSH</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For example, say you run <code>git push origin master</code> in your project, and <code>origin</code> is defined as a URL that uses the SSH protocol.
Git fires up the <code>send-pack</code> process, which initiates a connection over SSH to your server.
It tries to run a command on the remote server via an SSH call that looks something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ ssh -x git@server "git-receive-pack 'simplegit-progit.git'"
00a5ca82a6dff817ec66f4437202690a93763949 refs/heads/master□report-status \
	delete-refs side-band-64k quiet ofs-delta \
	agent=git/2:2.1.1+github-607-gfba4028 delete-refs
0000</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git-receive-pack</code> command immediately responds with one line for each reference it currently has – in this case, just the <code>master</code> branch and its SHA-1.
The first line also has a list of the server&#8217;s capabilities (here, <code>report-status</code>, <code>delete-refs</code>, and some others, including the client identifier).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Each line starts with a 4-character hex value specifying how long the rest of the line is.
Your first line starts with 00a5, which is hexadecimal for 165, meaning that 165 bytes remain on that line.
The next line is 0000, meaning the server is done with its references listing.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now that it knows the server&#8217;s state, your <code>send-pack</code> process determines what commits it has that the server doesn&#8217;t.
For each reference that this push will update, the <code>send-pack</code> process tells the <code>receive-pack</code> process that information.
For instance, if you&#8217;re updating the <code>master</code> branch and adding an <code>experiment</code> branch, the <code>send-pack</code> response may look something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>0076ca82a6dff817ec66f44342007202690a93763949 15027957951b64cf874c3557a0f3547bd83b3ff6 \

	refs/heads/experiment
0000</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git sends a line for each reference you&#8217;re updating with the line&#8217;s length, the old SHA-1, the new SHA-1, and the reference that is being updated.
The first line also has the client&#8217;s capabilities.
The SHA-1 value of all '0&#8217;s means that nothing was there before – because you&#8217;re adding the experiment reference.
If you were deleting a reference, you would see the opposite: all '0&#8217;s on the right side.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Next, the client sends a packfile of all the objects the server doesn&#8217;t have yet.
Finally, the server responds with a success (or failure) indication:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>000eunpack ok</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_http_s">HTTP(S)</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This process is mostly the same over HTTP, though the handshaking is a bit different.
The connection is initiated with this request:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>That&#8217;s the end of the first client-server exchange.
The client then makes another request, this time a <code>POST</code>, with the data that <code>send-pack</code> provides.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>=&gt; POST http://server/simplegit-progit.git/git-receive-pack</code></pre>

The server then indicates success or failure with its HTTP response.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_downloading_data">Downloading Data</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
When you download data, the <code>fetch-pack</code> and <code>upload-pack</code> processes are involved.
The client initiates a <code>fetch-pack</code> process that connects to an <code>upload-pack</code> process on the remote side to negotiate what data will be transferred down.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect5">
<h6 id="_ssh_2">SSH</h6>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re doing the fetch over SSH, <code>fetch-pack</code> runs something like this:</p>

<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ ssh -x git@server "git-upload-pack 'simplegit-progit.git'"</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>After <code>fetch-pack</code> connects, <code>upload-pack</code> sends back something like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is very similar to what <code>receive-pack</code> responds with, but the capabilities are different.
In addition, it sends back what HEAD points to (<code>symref=HEAD:refs/heads/master</code>) so the client knows what to check out if this is a clone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At this point, the <code>fetch-pack</code> process looks at what objects it has and responds with the objects that it needs by sending &#8220;want&#8221; and then the SHA-1 it wants.
It sends all the objects it already has with &#8220;have&#8221; and then the SHA-1.
At the end of this list, it writes &#8220;done&#8221; to initiate the <code>upload-pack</code> process to begin sending the packfile of the data it needs:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>This section contains a very basic overview of the transfer protocols.
The protocol includes many other features, such as <code>multi_ack</code> or <code>side-band</code> capabilities, but covering them is outside the scope of this book.
We&#8217;ve tried to give you a sense of the general back-and-forth between client and server; if you need more knowledge than this, you&#8217;ll probably want to take a look at the Git source code.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_maintenance_and_data_recovery">Maintenance and Data Recovery</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Occasionally, you may have to do some cleanup – make a repository more compact, clean up an imported repository, or recover lost work.
This section will cover some of these scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_gc">Maintenance</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Occasionally, Git automatically runs a command called &#8220;auto gc&#8221;.
Most of the time, this command does nothing.
However, if there are too many loose objects (objects not in a packfile) or too many packfiles, Git launches a full-fledged <code>git gc</code> command.
The &#8220;gc&#8221; stands for garbage collect, and the command does a number of things: it gathers up all the loose objects and places them in packfiles, it consolidates packfiles into one big packfile, and it removes objects that aren&#8217;t reachable from any commit and are a few months old.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You can run auto gc manually as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git gc --auto</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Again, this generally does nothing.
You must have around 7,000 loose objects or more than 50 packfiles for Git to fire up a real gc command.
You can modify these limits with the <code>gc.auto</code> and <code>gc.autopacklimit</code> config settings, respectively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The other thing <code>gc</code> will do is pack up your references into a single file.
Suppose your repository contains the following branches and tags:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ find .git/refs -type f
.git/refs/heads/experiment
.git/refs/heads/master
.git/refs/tags/v1.0
.git/refs/tags/v1.1</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you run <code>git gc</code>, you&#8217;ll no longer have these files in the <code>refs</code> directory.
Git will move them for the sake of efficiency into a file named <code>.git/packed-refs</code> that looks like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ cat .git/packed-refs
# pack-refs with: peeled fully-peeled
cac0cab538b970a37ea1e769cbbde608743bc96d refs/heads/experiment

^1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you update a reference, Git doesn&#8217;t edit this file but instead writes a new file to <code>refs/heads</code>.
To get the appropriate SHA-1 for a given reference, Git checks for that reference in the <code>refs</code> directory and then checks the <code>packed-refs</code> file as a fallback.
However, if you can&#8217;t find a reference in the <code>refs</code> directory, it&#8217;s probably in your <code>packed-refs</code> file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Notice the last line of the file, which begins with a <code>^</code>.
This means the tag directly above is an annotated tag and that line is the commit that the annotated tag points to.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_data_recovery">Data Recovery</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>At some point in your Git journey, you may accidentally lose a commit.
Generally, this happens because you force-delete a branch that had work on it, and it turns out you wanted the branch after all; or you hard-reset a branch, thus abandoning commits that you wanted something from.
Assuming this happens, how can you get your commits back?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here&#8217;s an example that hard-resets the master branch in your test repository to an older commit and then recovers the lost commits.
First, let&#8217;s review where your repository is at this point:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git log --pretty=oneline

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Now, move the <code>master</code> branch back to the middle commit:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git reset --hard 1a410efbd13591db07496601ebc7a059dd55cfe9

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You&#8217;ve effectively lost the top two commits – you have no branch from which those commits are reachable.
You need to find the latest commit SHA-1 and then add a branch that points to it.
The trick is finding that latest commit SHA-1 – it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;ve memorized it, right?</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Often, the quickest way is to use a tool called <code>git reflog</code>.
As you&#8217;re working, Git silently records what your HEAD is every time you change it.
Each time you commit or change branches, the reflog is updated.
The reflog is also updated by the <code>git update-ref</code> command, which is another reason to use it instead of just writing the SHA-1 value to your ref files, as we covered in <a href="#_git_refs">Git References</a>.
You can see where you&#8217;ve been at any time by running <code>git reflog</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Here we can see the two commits that we have had checked out, however there is not much information here.
To see the same information in a much more useful way, we can run <code>git log -g</code>, which will give you a normal log output for your reflog.</p>

<p>It looks like the bottom commit is the one you lost, so you can recover it by creating a new branch at that commit.

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cool – now you have a branch named <code>recover-branch</code> that is where your <code>master</code> branch used to be, making the first two commits reachable again.
Next, suppose your loss was for some reason not in the reflog – you can simulate that by removing <code>recover-branch</code> and deleting the reflog.
Now the first two commits aren&#8217;t reachable by anything:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Because the reflog data is kept in the <code>.git/logs/</code> directory, you effectively have no reflog.
How can you recover that commit at this point?
One way is to use the <code>git fsck</code> utility, which checks your database for integrity.
If you run it with the <code>--full</code> option, it shows you all objects that aren&#8217;t pointed to by another object:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git fsck --full

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In this case, you can see your missing commit after the string &#8220;dangling commit&#8221;.
You can recover it the same way, by adding a branch that points to that SHA-1.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_removing_objects">Removing Objects</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a lot of great things about Git, but one feature that can cause issues is the fact that a <code>git clone</code> downloads the entire history of the project, including every version of every file.
This is fine if the whole thing is source code, because Git is highly optimized to compress that data efficiently.
However, if someone at any point in the history of your project added a single huge file, every clone for all time will be forced to download that large file, even if it was removed from the project in the very next commit.
Because it&#8217;s reachable from the history, it will always be there.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This can be a huge problem when you&#8217;re converting Subversion or Perforce repositories into Git.
Because you don&#8217;t download the whole history in those systems, this type of addition carries few consequences.
If you did an import from another system or otherwise find that your repository is much larger than it should be, here is how you can find and remove large objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong>Be warned: this technique is destructive to your commit history.</strong>
It rewrites every commit object since the earliest tree you have to modify to remove a large file reference.
If you do this immediately after an import, before anyone has started to base work on the commit, you&#8217;re fine – otherwise, you have to notify all contributors that they must rebase their work onto your new commits.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To demonstrate, you&#8217;ll add a large file into your test repository, remove it in the next commit, find it, and remove it permanently from the repository.
First, add a large object to your history:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>size-pack</code> entry is the size of your packfiles in kilobytes, so you&#8217;re using almost 5MB.
Before the last commit, you were using closer to 2K – clearly, removing the file from the previous commit didn&#8217;t remove it from your history.
Every time anyone clones this repository, they will have to clone all 5MB just to get this tiny project, because you accidentally added a big file.
Let&#8217;s get rid of it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First you have to find it.
In this case, you already know what file it is.
But suppose you didn&#8217;t; how would you identify what file or files were taking up so much space?
If you run <code>git gc</code>, all the objects are in a packfile; you can identify the big objects by running another plumbing command called <code>git verify-pack</code> and sorting on the third field in the output, which is file size.
You can also pipe it through the <code>tail</code> command because you&#8217;re only interested in the last few largest files:</p>
</div>

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The big object is at the bottom: 5MB.
To find out what file it is, you&#8217;ll use the <code>rev-list</code> command, which you used briefly in <a href="#_enforcing_commit_message_format">Enforcing a Specific Commit-Message Format</a>.
If you pass <code>--objects</code> to <code>rev-list</code>, it lists all the commit SHA-1s and also the blob SHA-1s with the file paths associated with them.

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You must rewrite all the commits downstream from <code>7b30847</code> to fully remove this file from your Git history.
To do so, you use <code>filter-branch</code>, which you used in <a href="#_rewriting_history">Rewriting History</a>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">

</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>--index-filter</code> option is similar to the <code>--tree-filter</code> option used in <a href="#_rewriting_history">Rewriting History</a>, except that instead of passing a command that modifies files checked out on disk, you&#8217;re modifying your staging area or index each time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rather than remove a specific file with something like <code>rm file</code>, you have to remove it with <code>git rm --cached</code> – you must remove it from the index, not from disk.
The reason to do it this way is speed – because Git doesn&#8217;t have to check out each revision to disk before running your filter, the process can be much, much faster.
You can accomplish the same task with <code>--tree-filter</code> if you want.
The <code>--ignore-unmatch</code> option to <code>git rm</code> tells it not to error out if the pattern you&#8217;re trying to remove isn&#8217;t there.
Finally, you ask <code>filter-branch</code> to rewrite your history only from the <code>7b30847</code> commit up, because you know that is where this problem started.
Otherwise, it will start from the beginning and will unnecessarily take longer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Your history no longer contains a reference to that file.
However, your reflog and a new set of refs that Git added when you did the <code>filter-branch</code> under <code>.git/refs/original</code> still do, so you have to remove them and then repack the database.
You need to get rid of anything that has a pointer to those old commits before you repack:</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>HOME</code></strong> isn&#8217;t usually considered customizable (too many other things depend on it), but it&#8217;s where Git looks for the global configuration file.
  If you want a truly portable Git installation, complete with global configuration, you can override <code>HOME</code> in the portable Git&#8217;s shell profile.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>PREFIX</code></strong> is similar, but for the system-wide configuration.
  Git looks for this file at <code>$PREFIX/etc/gitconfig</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_CONFIG_NOSYSTEM</code></strong>, if set, disables the use of the system-wide configuration file.
  This is useful if your system config is interfering with your commands, but you don&#8217;t have access to change or remove it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_PAGER</code></strong> controls the program used to display multi-page output on the command line.
If this is unset, <code>PAGER</code> will be used as a fallback.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_EDITOR</code></strong> is the editor Git will launch when the user needs to edit some text (a commit message, for example).
If unset, <code>EDITOR</code> will be used.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_repository_locations">Repository Locations</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git uses several environment variables to determine how it interfaces with the current repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_DIR</code></strong> is the location of the <code>.git</code> folder.
If this isn&#8217;t specified, Git walks up the directory tree until it gets to <code>~</code> or <code>/</code>, looking for a <code>.git</code> directory at every step.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_CEILING_DIRECTORIES</code></strong> controls the behavior of searching for a <code>.git</code> directory.
If you access directories that are slow to load (such as those on a tape drive, or across a slow network connection), you may want to have Git stop trying earlier than it might otherwise, especially if Git is invoked when building your shell prompt.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_WORK_TREE</code></strong> is the location of the root of the working directory for a non-bare repository.
If not specified, the parent directory of <code>$GIT_DIR</code> is used.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_INDEX_FILE</code></strong> is the path to the index file (non-bare repositories only).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY</code></strong> can be used to specify the location of the directory that usually resides at <code>.git/objects</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_ALTERNATE_OBJECT_DIRECTORIES</code></strong> is a colon-separated list (formatted like <code>/dir/one:/dir/two:…</code>) which tells Git where to check for objects if they aren&#8217;t in <code>GIT_OBJECT_DIRECTORY</code>.
If you happen to have a lot of projects with large files that have the exact same contents, this can be used to avoid storing too many copies of them.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_pathspecs">Pathspecs</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A &#8220;pathspec&#8221; refers to how you specify paths to things in Git, including the use of wildcards.
These are used in the <code>.gitignore</code> file, but also on the command-line (<code>git add *.c</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS</code> and <code>GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS</code></strong> control the default behavior of wildcards in pathspecs.
If <code>GIT_GLOB_PATHSPECS</code> is set to 1, wildcard characters act as wildcards (which is the default); if <code>GIT_NOGLOB_PATHSPECS</code> is set to 1, wildcard characters only match themselves, meaning something like <code>*.c</code> would only match a file <em>named</em> &#8220;*.c&#8221;, rather than any file whose name ends with <code>.c</code>.
You can override this in individual cases by starting the pathspec with <code>:(glob)</code> or <code>:(literal)</code>, as in <code>:(glob)*.c</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_LITERAL_PATHSPECS</code></strong> disables both of the above behaviors; no wildcard characters will work, and the override prefixes are disabled as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_ICASE_PATHSPECS</code></strong> sets all pathspecs to work in a case-insensitive manner.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_committing">Committing</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The final creation of a Git commit object is usually done by <code>git-commit-tree</code>, which uses these environment variables as its primary source of information, falling back to configuration values only if these aren&#8217;t present.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_AUTHOR_NAME</code></strong> is the human-readable name in the &#8220;author&#8221; field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_AUTHOR_EMAIL</code></strong> is the email for the &#8220;author&#8221; field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_AUTHOR_DATE</code></strong> is the timestamp used for the &#8220;author&#8221; field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_COMMITTER_NAME</code></strong> sets the human name for the &#8220;committer&#8221; field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_COMMITTER_EMAIL</code></strong> is the email address for the &#8220;committer&#8221; field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_COMMITTER_DATE</code></strong> is used for the timestamp in the &#8220;committer&#8221; field.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>EMAIL</code></strong> is the fallback email address in case the <code>user.email</code> configuration value isn&#8217;t set.
If <em>this</em> isn&#8217;t set, Git falls back to the system user and host names.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_networking">Networking</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git uses the <code>curl</code> library to do network operations over HTTP, so <strong><code>GIT_CURL_VERBOSE</code></strong> tells Git to emit all the messages generated by that library.
This is similar to doing <code>curl -v</code> on the command line.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_SSL_NO_VERIFY</code></strong> tells Git not to verify SSL certificates.
This can sometimes be necessary if you&#8217;re using a self-signed certificate to serve Git repositories over HTTPS, or you&#8217;re in the middle of setting up a Git server but haven&#8217;t installed a full certificate yet.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If the data rate of an HTTP operation is lower than <strong><code>GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_LIMIT</code></strong> bytes per second for longer than <strong><code>GIT_HTTP_LOW_SPEED_TIME</code></strong> seconds, Git will abort that operation.
These values override the <code>http.lowSpeedLimit</code> and <code>http.lowSpeedTime</code> configuration values.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_HTTP_USER_AGENT</code></strong> sets the user-agent string used by Git when communicating over HTTP.
The default is a value like <code>git/2.0.0</code>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_diffing_and_merging">Diffing and Merging</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_DIFF_OPTS</code></strong> is a bit of a misnomer.
The only valid values are <code>-u&lt;n&gt;</code> or <code>--unified=&lt;n&gt;</code>, which controls the number of context lines shown in a <code>git diff</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF</code></strong> is used as an override for the <code>diff.external</code> configuration value.
If it&#8217;s set, Git will invoke this program when <code>git diff</code> is invoked.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_DIFF_PATH_COUNTER</code></strong> and <strong><code>GIT_DIFF_PATH_TOTAL</code></strong> are useful from inside the program specified by <code>GIT_EXTERNAL_DIFF</code> or <code>diff.external</code>.
The former represents which file in a series is being diffed (starting with 1), and the latter is the total number of files in the batch.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_MERGE_VERBOSITY</code></strong> controls the output for the recursive merge strategy.
The allowed values are as follows:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>0 outputs nothing, except possibly a single error message.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>1 shows only conflicts.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>2 also shows file changes.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>3 shows when files are skipped because they haven&#8217;t changed.</p>

<li>
<p>4 shows all paths as they are processed.</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p>&#8220;true&#8221;, &#8220;1&#8221;, or &#8220;2&#8221; – the trace category is written to stderr.</p>

<p><strong><code>GIT_SSH</code></strong>, if specified, is a program that is invoked instead of <code>ssh</code> when Git tries to connect to an SSH host.
It is invoked like <code>$GIT_SSH [username@]host [-p &lt;port&gt;] &lt;command&gt;</code>.
Note that this isn&#8217;t the easiest way to customize how <code>ssh</code> is invoked; it won&#8217;t support extra command-line parameters, so you&#8217;d have to write a wrapper script and set <code>GIT_SSH</code> to point to it.
It&#8217;s probably easier just to use the <code>~/.ssh/config</code> file for that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_ASKPASS</code></strong> is an override for the <code>core.askpass</code> configuration value.
This is the program invoked whenever Git needs to ask the user for credentials, which can expect a text prompt as a command-line argument, and should return the answer on <code>stdout</code>.
(See <a href="#_credential_caching">Credential Storage</a> for more on this subsystem.)</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_NAMESPACE</code></strong> controls access to namespaced refs, and is equivalent to the <code>--namespace</code> flag.
This is mostly useful on the server side, where you may want to store multiple forks of a single repository in one repository, only keeping the refs separate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><strong><code>GIT_FLUSH</code></strong> can be used to force Git to use non-buffered I/O when writing incrementally to stdout.
A value of 1 causes Git to flush more often, a value of 0 causes all output to be buffered.
The default value (if this variable is not set) is to choose an appropriate buffering scheme depending on the activity and the output mode.</p>

<h3 id="_summary_13">Summary</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>You should have a pretty good understanding of what Git does in the background and, to some degree, how it&#8217;s implemented.
This chapter has covered a number of plumbing commands – commands that are lower level and simpler than the porcelain commands you&#8217;ve learned about in the rest of the book.
Understanding how Git works at a lower level should make it easier to understand why it&#8217;s doing what it&#8217;s doing and also to write your own tools and helping scripts to make your specific workflow work for you.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git as a content-addressable filesystem is a very powerful tool that you can easily use as more than just a VCS.
We hope you can use your newfound knowledge of Git internals to implement your own cool application of this technology and feel more comfortable using Git in more advanced ways.</p>

<h2 id="_git_in_other_environments">Appendix A: Git in Other Environments</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you read through the whole book, you&#8217;ve learned a lot about how to use Git at the command line.
You can work with local files, connect your repository to others over a network, and work effectively with others.
But the story doesn&#8217;t end there; Git is usually used as part of a larger ecosystem, and the terminal isn&#8217;t always the best way to work with it.
Now we&#8217;ll take a look at some of the other kinds of environments where Git can be useful, and how other applications (including yours) work alongside Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_graphical_interfaces">Graphical Interfaces</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Git&#8217;s native environment is in the terminal.
New features show up there first, and only at the command line is the full power of Git completely at your disposal.
But plain text isn&#8217;t the best choice for all tasks; sometimes a visual representation is what you need, and some users are much more comfortable with a point-and-click interface.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s important to note that different interfaces are tailored for different workflows.
Some clients expose only a carefully curated subset of Git functionality, in order to support a specific way of working that the author considers effective.
When viewed in this light, none of these tools can be called &#8220;better&#8221; than any of the others, they&#8217;re simply more fit for their intended purpose.
Also note that there&#8217;s nothing these graphical clients can do that the command-line client can&#8217;t; the command-line is still where you&#8217;ll have the most power and control when working with your repositories.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="__code_gitk_code_and_code_git_gui_code"><code>gitk</code> and <code>git-gui</code></h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
When you install Git, you also get its visual tools, <code>gitk</code> and <code>git-gui</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>gitk</code> is a graphical history viewer.
Think of it like a powerful GUI shell over <code>git log</code> and <code>git grep</code>.
This is the tool to use when you&#8217;re trying to find something that happened in the past, or visualize your project&#8217;s history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gitk is easiest to invoke from the command-line.
Just <code>cd</code> into a Git repository, and type:</p>

<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ gitk [git log options]</code></pre>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Gitk accepts many command-line options, most of which are passed through to the underlying <code>git log</code> action.
Probably one of the most useful is the <code>--all</code> flag, which tells gitk to show commits reachable from <em>any</em> ref, not just HEAD.
Gitk&#8217;s interface looks like this:</p>

<p>On the top is something that looks a bit like the output of <code>git log --graph</code>; each dot represents a commit, the lines represent parent relationships, and refs are shown as colored boxes.
The yellow dot represents HEAD, and the red dot represents changes that are yet to become a commit.
At the bottom is a view of the selected commit; the comments and patch on the left, and a summary view on the right.
In between is a collection of controls used for searching history.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p><code>git-gui</code>, on the other hand, is primarily a tool for crafting commits.

<p>At the bottom right is the message and action area.
Type your message into the text box and click &#8220;Commit&#8221; to do something similar to <code>git commit</code>.
You can also choose to amend the last commit by choosing the &#8220;Amend&#8221; radio button, which will update the &#8220;Staged Changes&#8221; area with the contents of the last commit.
Then you can simply stage or unstage some changes, alter the commit message, and click &#8220;Commit&#8221; again to replace the old commit with a new one.</p>

GitHub has created two workflow-oriented Git clients: one for Windows, and one for Mac.
These clients are a good example of workflow-oriented tools – rather than expose <em>all</em> of Git&#8217;s functionality, they instead focus on a curated set of commonly-used features that work well together.
They look like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">

<img src="images/github_win.png" alt="GitHub for Windows.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 156. GitHub for Windows.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>They are designed to look and work very much alike, so we&#8217;ll treat them like a single product in this chapter.
We won&#8217;t be doing a detailed rundown of these tools (they have their own documentation), but a quick tour of the &#8220;changes&#8221; view (which is where you&#8217;ll spend most of your time) is in order.</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>On the left is the list of repositories the client is tracking; you can add a repository (either by cloning or attaching locally) by clicking the &#8220;+&#8221; icon at the top of this area.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>In the center is a commit-input area, which lets you input a commit message, and select which files should be included.
(On Windows, the commit history is displayed directly below this; on Mac, it&#8217;s on a separate tab.)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the right is a diff view, which shows what&#8217;s changed in your working directory, or which changes were included in the selected commit.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The last thing to notice is the &#8220;Sync&#8221; button at the top-right, which is the primary way you interact over the network.</p>
</li>
</ul>

<h5 id="_installation_2">Installation</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>GitHub for Windows can be downloaded from <a href="https://windows.github.com" class="bare">https://windows.github.com</a>, and GitHub for Mac from <a href="https://mac.github.com" class="bare">https://mac.github.com</a>.
When the applications are first run, they walk you through all the first-time Git setup, such as configuring your name and email address, and both set up sane defaults for many common configuration options, such as credential caches and CRLF behavior.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both are &#8220;evergreen&#8221; – updates are downloaded and installed in the background while the applications are open.
This helpfully includes a bundled version of Git, which means you probably won&#8217;t have to worry about manually updating it again.
On Windows, the client includes a shortcut to launch Powershell with Posh-git, which we&#8217;ll talk more about later in this chapter.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next step is to give the tool some repositories to work with.
The client shows you a list of the repositories you have access to on GitHub, and can clone them in one step.
If you already have a local repository, just drag its directory from the Finder or Windows Explorer into the GitHub client window, and it will be included in the list of repositories on the left.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_recommended_workflow">Recommended Workflow</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once it&#8217;s installed and configured, you can use the GitHub client for many common Git tasks.
The intended workflow for this tool is sometimes called the &#8220;GitHub Flow.&#8221;
We cover this in more detail in <a href="#_github_flow">The GitHub Flow</a>, but the general gist is that (a) you&#8217;ll be committing to a branch, and (b) you&#8217;ll be syncing up with a remote repository fairly regularly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Branch management is one of the areas where the two tools diverge.
On Mac, there&#8217;s a button at the top of the window for creating a new branch:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/branch_widget_mac.png" alt="``Create Branch'' button on Mac.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 157. &#8220;Create Branch&#8221; button on Mac.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>On Windows, this is done by typing the new branch&#8217;s name in the branch-switching widget:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/branch_widget_win.png" alt="Creating a branch on Windows.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 158. Creating a branch on Windows.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once your branch is created, making new commits is fairly straightforward.
Make some changes in your working directory, and when you switch to the GitHub client window, it will show you which files changed.
Enter a commit message, select the files you&#8217;d like to include, and click the &#8220;Commit&#8221; button (ctrl-enter or ⌘-enter).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The main way you interact with other repositories over the network is through the &#8220;Sync&#8221; feature.
Git internally has separate operations for pushing, fetching, merging, and rebasing, but the GitHub clients collapse all of these into one multi-step feature.
Here&#8217;s what happens when you click the Sync button:</p>
</div>
<div class="olist arabic">
<ol class="arabic">
<li>
<p><code>git pull --rebase</code>.
If this fails because of a merge conflict, fall back to <code>git pull --no-rebase</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>git push</code>.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is the most common sequence of network commands when working in this style, so squashing them into one command saves a lot of time.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect4">
<h5 id="_summary_14">Summary</h5>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>These tools are very well-suited for the workflow they&#8217;re designed for.
Developers and non-developers alike can be collaborating on a project within minutes, and many of the best practices for this kind of workflow are baked into the tools.
However, if your workflow is different, or you want more control over how and when network operations are done, we recommend you use another client or the command line.</p>

<h4 id="_other_guis">Other GUIs</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a number of other graphical Git clients, and they run the gamut from specialized, single-purpose tools all the way to apps that try to expose everything Git can do.
The official Git website has a curated list of the most popular clients at <a href="http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis" class="bare">http://git-scm.com/downloads/guis</a>.

<h3 id="_git_in_visual_studio">Git in Visual Studio</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Starting with Visual Studio 2013 Update 1, Visual Studio users have a Git client built directly into their IDE.
Visual Studio has had source-control integration features for quite some time, but they were oriented towards centralized, file-locking systems, and Git was not a good match for this workflow.
Visual Studio 2013&#8217;s Git support has been separated from this older feature, and the result is a much better fit between Studio and Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To locate the feature, open a project that&#8217;s controlled by Git (or just <code>git init</code> an existing project), and select View &gt; Team Explorer from the menu.
You&#8217;ll see the "Connect" view, which looks a bit like this:</p>

<p>Visual Studio remembers all of the projects you&#8217;ve opened that are Git-controlled, and they&#8217;re available in the list at the bottom.
If you don&#8217;t see the one you want there, click the "Add" link and type in the path to the working directory.
Double clicking on one of the local Git repositories leads you to the Home view, which looks like <a href="#vs_home">The "Home" view for a Git repository in Visual Studio.</a>.
This is a hub for performing Git actions; when you&#8217;re <em>writing</em> code, you&#8217;ll probably spend most of your time in the "Changes" view, but when it comes time to pull down changes made by your teammates, you&#8217;ll use the "Unsynced Commits" and "Branches" views.</p>

Eclipse ships with a plugin called Egit, which provides a fairly-complete interface to Git operations.

<h3 id="_git_in_bash">Git in Bash</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If you&#8217;re a Bash user, you can tap into some of your shell&#8217;s features to make your experience with Git a lot friendlier.
Git actually ships with plugins for several shells, but it&#8217;s not turned on by default.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, you need to get a copy of the <code>contrib/completion/git-completion.bash</code> file out of the Git source code.
Copy it somewhere handy, like your home directory, and add this to your <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">. ~/git-completion.bash</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once that&#8217;s done, change your directory to a Git repository, and type:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git chec&lt;tab&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>…and Bash will auto-complete to <code>git checkout</code>.
This works with all of Git&#8217;s subcommands, command-line parameters, and remotes and ref names where appropriate.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s also useful to customize your prompt to show information about the current directory&#8217;s Git repository.
This can be as simple or complex as you want, but there are generally a few key pieces of information that most people want, like the current branch, and the status of the working directory.
To add these to your prompt, just copy the <code>contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh</code> file from Git&#8217;s source repository to your home directory, add something like this to your <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">. ~/git-prompt.sh
export GIT_PS1_SHOWDIRTYSTATE=1
export PS1='\w$(__git_ps1 " (%s)")\$ '</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>\w</code> means print the current working directory, the <code>\$</code> prints the <code>$</code> part of the prompt, and <code>__git_ps1 " (%s)"</code> calls the function provided by <code>git-prompt.sh</code> with a formatting argument.
Now your bash prompt will look like this when you&#8217;re anywhere inside a Git-controlled project:</p>

<div class="title">Figure 162. Customized <code>bash</code> prompt.</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Both of these scripts come with helpful documentation; take a look at the contents of <code>git-completion.bash</code> and <code>git-prompt.sh</code> for more information.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_git_in_zsh">Git in Zsh</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Zsh also ships with a tab-completion library for Git.
To use it, simply run <code>autoload -Uz compinit &amp;&amp; compinit</code> in your <code>.zshrc</code>.
Zsh&#8217;s interface is a bit more powerful than Bash&#8217;s:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">$ git che&lt;tab&gt;
check-attr        -- display gitattributes information
check-ref-format  -- ensure that a reference name is well formed
checkout          -- checkout branch or paths to working tree
checkout-index    -- copy files from index to working directory
cherry            -- find commits not merged upstream
cherry-pick       -- apply changes introduced by some existing commits</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Ambiguous tab-completions aren&#8217;t just listed; they have helpful descriptions, and you can graphically navigate the list by repeatedly hitting tab.
This works with Git commands, their arguments, and names of things inside the repository (like refs and remotes), as well as filenames and all the other things Zsh knows how to tab-complete.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Zsh ships with a framework for getting information from version control systems, called <code>vcs_info</code>.
To include the branch name in the prompt on the right side, add these lines to your <code>~/.zshrc</code> file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-console" data-lang="console">autoload -Uz vcs_info
precmd_vcs_info() { vcs_info }
precmd_functions+=( precmd_vcs_info )
setopt prompt_subst
RPROMPT=\$vcs_info_msg_0_
# PROMPT=\$vcs_info_msg_0_'%# '
zstyle ':vcs_info:git:*' formats '%b'</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This results in a display of the current branch on the right-hand side of the terminal window, whenever your shell is inside a Git repository.
(The left side is supported as well, of course; just uncomment the assignment to PROMPT.)
It looks a bit like this:</p>
</div>
<div class="imageblock">
<div class="content">
<img src="images/zsh-prompt.png" alt="Customized `zsh` prompt.">
</div>
<div class="title">Figure 163. Customized <code>zsh</code> prompt.</div>

<p>For more information on vcs_info, check out its documentation
        in the <code>zshcontrib(1)</code> manual page,

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Instead of vcs_info, you might prefer the prompt customization script that ships with Git, called <code>git-prompt.sh</code>; see <a href="https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh" class="bare">https://github.com/git/git/blob/master/contrib/completion/git-prompt.sh</a> for details.
<code>git-prompt.sh</code> is compatible with both Bash and Zsh.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Zsh is powerful enough that there are entire frameworks dedicated to making it better.
One of them is called "oh-my-zsh", and it can be found at <a href="https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh" class="bare">https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh</a>.
oh-my-zsh&#8217;s plugin system comes with powerful git tab-completion, and it has a variety of prompt "themes", many of which display version-control data.

The standard command-line terminal on Windows (<code>cmd.exe</code>) isn&#8217;t really capable of a customized Git experience, but if you&#8217;re using Powershell, you&#8217;re in luck.
A package called Posh-Git (<a href="https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git" class="bare">https://github.com/dahlbyk/posh-git</a>) provides powerful tab-completion facilities, as well as an enhanced prompt to help you stay on top of your repository status.

<h2 id="_embedding_git_in_your_applications">Appendix B: Embedding Git in your Applications</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If your application is for developers, chances are good that it could benefit from integration with source control.
Even non-developer applications, such as document editors, could potentially benefit from version-control features, and Git&#8217;s model works very well for many different scenarios.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you need to integrate Git with your application, you have essentially three choices: spawning a shell and using the Git command-line tool; Libgit2; and JGit.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_command_line_git">Command-line Git</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One option is to spawn a shell process and use the Git command-line tool to do the work.
This has the benefit of being canonical, and all of Git&#8217;s features are supported.
This also happens to be fairly easy, as most runtime environments have a relatively simple facility for invoking a process with command-line arguments.
However, this approach does have some downsides.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>One is that all the output is in plain text.
This means that you&#8217;ll have to parse Git&#8217;s occasionally-changing output format to read progress and result information, which can be inefficient and error-prone.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Another is the lack of error recovery.
If a repository is corrupted somehow, or the user has a malformed configuration value, Git will simply refuse to perform many operations.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Yet another is process management.
Git requires you to maintain a shell environment on a separate process, which can add unwanted complexity.
Trying to coordinate many of these processes (especially when potentially accessing the same repository from several processes) can be quite a challenge.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_libgit2">Libgit2</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
Another option at your disposal is to use Libgit2.
Libgit2 is a dependency-free implementation of Git, with a focus on having a nice API for use within other programs.
You can find it at <a href="http://libgit2.github.com" class="bare">http://libgit2.github.com</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>First, let&#8217;s take a look at what the C API looks like.
Here&#8217;s a whirlwind tour:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">// Open a repository
git_repository *repo;
int error = git_repository_open(&amp;repo, "/path/to/repository");

// Dereference HEAD to a commit
git_object *head_commit;
error = git_revparse_single(&amp;head_commit, repo, "HEAD^{commit}");
git_commit *commit = (git_commit*)head_commit;

// Print some of the commit's properties
printf("%s", git_commit_message(commit));
const git_signature *author = git_commit_author(commit);
printf("%s &lt;%s&gt;\n", author-&gt;name, author-&gt;email);
const git_oid *tree_id = git_commit_tree_id(commit);

// Cleanup
git_commit_free(commit);
git_repository_free(repo);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first couple of lines open a Git repository.
The <code>git_repository</code> type represents a handle to a repository with a cache in memory.
This is the simplest method, for when you know the exact path to a repository&#8217;s working directory or <code>.git</code> folder.
There&#8217;s also the <code>git_repository_open_ext</code> which includes options for searching, <code>git_clone</code> and friends for making a local clone of a remote repository, and <code>git_repository_init</code> for creating an entirely new repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second chunk of code uses rev-parse syntax (see <a href="#_branch_references">Branch References</a> for more on this) to get the commit that HEAD eventually points to.
The type returned is a <code>git_object</code> pointer, which represents something that exists in the Git object database for a repository.
<code>git_object</code> is actually a &#8220;parent&#8221; type for several different kinds of objects; the memory layout for each of the &#8220;child&#8221; types is the same as for <code>git_object</code>, so you can safely cast to the right one.
In this case, <code>git_object_type(commit)</code> would return <code>GIT_OBJ_COMMIT</code>, so it&#8217;s safe to cast to a <code>git_commit</code> pointer.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next chunk shows how to access the commit&#8217;s properties.
The last line here uses a <code>git_oid</code> type; this is Libgit2&#8217;s representation for a SHA-1 hash.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>From this sample, a couple of patterns have started to emerge:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>If you declare a pointer and pass a reference to it into a Libgit2 call, that call will probably return an integer error code.
A <code>0</code> value indicates success; anything less is an error.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Libgit2 populates a pointer for you, you&#8217;re responsible for freeing it.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If Libgit2 returns a <code>const</code> pointer from a call, you don&#8217;t have to free it, but it will become invalid when the object it belongs to is freed.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Writing C is a bit painful.</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
That last one means it isn&#8217;t very probable that you&#8217;ll be writing C when using Libgit2.
Fortunately, there are a number of language-specific bindings available that make it fairly easy to work with Git repositories from your specific language and environment.
Let&#8217;s take a look at the above example written using the Ruby bindings for Libgit2, which are named Rugged, and can be found at <a href="https://github.com/libgit2/rugged" class="bare">https://github.com/libgit2/rugged</a>.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_advanced_functionality">Advanced Functionality</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Libgit2 has a couple of capabilities that are outside the scope of core Git.
One example is pluggability: Libgit2 allows you to provide custom &#8220;backends&#8221; for several types of operation, so you can store things in a different way than stock Git does.
Libgit2 allows custom backends for configuration, ref storage, and the object database, among other things.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Let&#8217;s take a look at how this works.
The code below is borrowed from the set of backend examples provided by the Libgit2 team (which can be found at <a href="https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2-backends" class="bare">https://github.com/libgit2/libgit2-backends</a>).
Here&#8217;s how a custom backend for the object database is set up:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">git_odb *odb;
int error = git_odb_new(&amp;odb); <b class="conum">(1)</b>

git_odb_backend *my_backend;
error = git_odb_backend_mine(&amp;my_backend, /*…*/); <b class="conum">(2)</b>

error = git_odb_add_backend(odb, my_backend, 1); <b class="conum">(3)</b>

git_repository *repo;
error = git_repository_open(&amp;repo, "some-path");
error = git_repository_set_odb(odb); <b class="conum">(4)</b></code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p><em>(Note that errors are captured, but not handled. We hope your code is better than ours.)</em></p>
</div>
<div class="colist arabic">
<ol>
<li>
<p>Initialize an empty object database (ODB) &#8220;frontend,&#8221; which will act as a container for the &#8220;backends&#8221; which are the ones doing the real work.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Initialize a custom ODB backend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Add the backend to the frontend.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Open a repository, and set it to use our ODB to look up objects.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>But what is this <code>git_odb_backend_mine</code> thing?
Well, that&#8217;s the constructor for your own ODB implementation, and you can do whatever you want in there, so long as you fill in the <code>git_odb_backend</code> structure properly.
Here&#8217;s what it <em>could</em> look like:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-c" data-lang="c">typedef struct {
    git_odb_backend parent;

    // Some other stuff
    void *custom_context;
} my_backend_struct;

int git_odb_backend_mine(git_odb_backend **backend_out, /*…*/)
{
    my_backend_struct *backend;

    backend = calloc(1, sizeof (my_backend_struct));

    backend-&gt;custom_context = …;

    backend-&gt;parent.read = &amp;my_backend__read;
    backend-&gt;parent.read_prefix = &amp;my_backend__read_prefix;
    backend-&gt;parent.read_header = &amp;my_backend__read_header;
    // …

    *backend_out = (git_odb_backend *) backend;

    return GIT_SUCCESS;
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The subtlest constraint here is that <code>my_backend_struct</code>'s first member must be a <code>git_odb_backend</code> structure; this ensures that the memory layout is what the Libgit2 code expects it to be.
The rest of it is arbitrary; this structure can be as large or small as you need it to be.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The initialization function allocates some memory for the structure, sets up the custom context, and then fills in the members of the <code>parent</code> structure that it supports.
Take a look at the <code>include/git2/sys/odb_backend.h</code> file in the Libgit2 source for a complete set of call signatures; your particular use case will help determine which of these you&#8217;ll want to support.</p>
</div>

<h4 id="_libgit2_bindings">Other Bindings</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Libgit2 has bindings for many languages.
Here we show a small example using a few of the more complete bindings packages as of this writing; libraries exist for many other languages, including C++, Go, Node.js, Erlang, and the JVM, all in various stages of maturity.
The official collection of bindings can be found by browsing the repositories at <a href="https://github.com/libgit2" class="bare">https://github.com/libgit2</a>.
The code we&#8217;ll write will return the commit message from the commit eventually pointed to by HEAD (sort of like <code>git log -1</code>).</p>

The bindings are written in C#, and great care has been taken to wrap the raw Libgit2 calls with native-feeling CLR APIs.
Here&#8217;s what our example program looks like:</p>

<h3 id="_jgit">JGit</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>
If you want to use Git from within a Java program, there is a fully featured Git library called JGit.
JGit is a relatively full-featured implementation of Git written natively in Java, and is widely used in the Java community.
The JGit project is under the Eclipse umbrella, and its home can be found at <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jgit" class="bare">http://www.eclipse.org/jgit</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_getting_set_up">Getting Set Up</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are a number of ways to connect your project with JGit and start writing code against it.
Probably the easiest is to use Maven – the integration is accomplished by adding the following snippet to the <code>&lt;dependencies&gt;</code> tag in your pom.xml file:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-xml" data-lang="xml">&lt;dependency&gt;
    &lt;groupId&gt;org.eclipse.jgit&lt;/groupId&gt;
    &lt;artifactId&gt;org.eclipse.jgit&lt;/artifactId&gt;
    &lt;version&gt;3.5.0.201409260305-r&lt;/version&gt;
&lt;/dependency&gt;</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>version</code> will most likely have advanced by the time you read this; check <a href="http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jgit/org.eclipse.jgit" class="bare">http://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.eclipse.jgit/org.eclipse.jgit</a> for updated repository information.
Once this step is done, Maven will automatically acquire and use the JGit libraries that you&#8217;ll need.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you would rather manage the binary dependencies yourself, pre-built JGit binaries are available from <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/jgit/download" class="bare">http://www.eclipse.org/jgit/download</a>.
You can build them into your project by running a command like this:</p>

</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_plumbing">Plumbing</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>JGit has two basic levels of API: plumbing and porcelain.
The terminology for these comes from Git itself, and JGit is divided into roughly the same kinds of areas: porcelain APIs are a friendly front-end for common user-level actions (the sorts of things a normal user would use the Git command-line tool for), while the plumbing APIs are for interacting with low-level repository objects directly.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The starting point for most JGit sessions is the <code>Repository</code> class, and the first thing you&#8217;ll want to do is create an instance of it.
For a filesystem-based repository (yes, JGit allows for other storage models), this is accomplished using <code>FileRepositoryBuilder</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">// Create a new repository
Repository newlyCreatedRepo = FileRepositoryBuilder.create(
    new File("/tmp/new_repo/.git"));
newlyCreatedRepo.create();

// Open an existing repository
Repository existingRepo = new FileRepositoryBuilder()
    .setGitDir(new File("my_repo/.git"))
    .build();</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The builder has a fluent API for providing all the things it needs to find a Git repository, whether or not your program knows exactly where it&#8217;s located.
It can use environment variables (<code>.readEnvironment()</code>), start from a place in the working directory and search (<code>.setWorkTree(…).findGitDir()</code>), or just open a known <code>.git</code> directory as above.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Once you have a <code>Repository</code> instance, you can do all sorts of things with it.
Here&#8217;s a quick sampling:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">// Get a reference
Ref master = repo.getRef("master");

// Get the object the reference points to
ObjectId masterTip = master.getObjectId();

// Rev-parse
ObjectId obj = repo.resolve("HEAD^{tree}");

// Load raw object contents
ObjectLoader loader = repo.open(masterTip);
loader.copyTo(System.out);

// Create a branch
RefUpdate createBranch1 = repo.updateRef("refs/heads/branch1");
createBranch1.setNewObjectId(masterTip);
createBranch1.update();

// Delete a branch
RefUpdate deleteBranch1 = repo.updateRef("refs/heads/branch1");
deleteBranch1.setForceUpdate(true);
deleteBranch1.delete();

// Config
Config cfg = repo.getConfig();
String name = cfg.getString("user", null, "name");</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There&#8217;s quite a bit going on here, so let&#8217;s go through it one section at a time.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first line gets a pointer to the <code>master</code> reference.
JGit automatically grabs the <em>actual</em> master ref, which lives at <code>refs/heads/master</code>, and returns an object that lets you fetch information about the reference.
You can get the name (<code>.getName()</code>), and either the target object of a direct reference (<code>.getObjectId()</code>) or the reference pointed to by a symbolic ref (<code>.getTarget()</code>).
Ref objects are also used to represent tag refs and objects, so you can ask if the tag is &#8220;peeled,&#8221; meaning that it points to the final target of a (potentially long) string of tag objects.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The second line gets the target of the <code>master</code> reference, which is returned as an ObjectId instance.
ObjectId represents the SHA-1 hash of an object, which might or might not exist in Git&#8217;s object database.
The third line is similar, but shows how JGit handles the rev-parse syntax (for more on this, see <a href="#_branch_references">Branch References</a>); you can pass any object specifier that Git understands, and JGit will return either a valid ObjectId for that object, or <code>null</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next two lines show how to load the raw contents of an object.
In this example, we call <code>ObjectLoader.copyTo()</code> to stream the contents of the object directly to stdout, but ObjectLoader also has methods to read the type and size of an object, as well as return it as a byte array.
For large objects (where <code>.isLarge()</code> returns <code>true</code>), you can call <code>.openStream()</code> to get an InputStream-like object that can read the raw object data without pulling it all into memory at once.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The next few lines show what it takes to create a new branch.
We create a RefUpdate instance, configure some parameters, and call <code>.update()</code> to trigger the change.
Directly following this is the code to delete that same branch.
Note that <code>.setForceUpdate(true)</code> is required for this to work; otherwise the <code>.delete()</code> call will return <code>REJECTED</code>, and nothing will happen.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The last example shows how to fetch the <code>user.name</code> value from the Git configuration files.
This Config instance uses the repository we opened earlier for local configuration, but will automatically detect the global and system configuration files and read values from them as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is only a small sampling of the full plumbing API; there are many more methods and classes available.
Also not shown here is the way JGit handles errors, which is through the use of exceptions.
JGit APIs sometimes throw standard Java exceptions (such as <code>IOException</code>), but there are a host of JGit-specific exception types that are provided as well (such as <code>NoRemoteRepositoryException</code>, <code>CorruptObjectException</code>, and <code>NoMergeBaseException</code>).</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_porcelain">Porcelain</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The plumbing APIs are rather complete, but it can be cumbersome to string them together to achieve common goals, like adding a file to the index, or making a new commit.
JGit provides a higher-level set of APIs to help out with this, and the entry point to these APIs is the <code>Git</code> class:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">Repository repo;
// construct repo...
Git git = new Git(repo);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The Git class has a nice set of high-level <em>builder</em>-style methods that can be used to construct some pretty complex behavior.
Let&#8217;s take a look at an example – doing something like <code>git ls-remote</code>:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code class="language-java" data-lang="java">CredentialsProvider cp = new UsernamePasswordCredentialsProvider("username", "p4ssw0rd");
Collection&lt;Ref&gt; remoteRefs = git.lsRemote()
    .setCredentialsProvider(cp)
    .setRemote("origin")
    .setTags(true)
    .setHeads(false)
    .call();
for (Ref ref : remoteRefs) {
    System.out.println(ref.getName() + " -&gt; " + ref.getObjectId().name());
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This is a common pattern with the Git class; the methods return a command object that lets you chain method calls to set parameters, which are executed when you call <code>.call()</code>.
In this case, we&#8217;re asking the <code>origin</code> remote for tags, but not heads.
Also notice the use of a <code>CredentialsProvider</code> object for authentication.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many other commands are available through the Git class, including but not limited to <code>add</code>, <code>blame</code>, <code>commit</code>, <code>clean</code>, <code>push</code>, <code>rebase</code>, <code>revert</code>, and <code>reset</code>.</p>

</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We talk briefly about how you can change the default branch from &#8220;master&#8221; in <a href="#_remote_branches">Remote Branches</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use this command to create an empty bare repository for a server in <a href="#_bare_repo">Putting the Bare Repository on a Server</a>.</p>

<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_clone">git clone</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git clone</code> command is actually something of a wrapper around several other commands.
It creates a new directory, goes into it and runs <code>git init</code> to make it an empty Git repository, adds a remote (<code>git remote add</code>) to the URL that you pass it (by default named <code>origin</code>), runs a <code>git fetch</code> from that remote repository and then checks out the latest commit into your working directory with <code>git checkout</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git clone</code> command is used in dozens of places throughout the book, but we&#8217;ll just list a few interesting places.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It&#8217;s basically introduced and explained in <a href="#_git_cloning">Cloning an Existing Repository</a>, where we go through a few examples.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_git_on_the_server">Getting Git on a Server</a> we look at using the <code>--bare</code> option to create a copy of a Git repository with no working directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_bundling">Bundling</a> we use it to unbundle a bundled Git repository.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, in <a href="#_cloning_submodules">Cloning a Project with Submodules</a> we learn the <code>--recursive</code> option to make cloning a repository with submodules a little simpler.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Though it&#8217;s used in many other places through the book, these are the ones that are somewhat unique or where it is used in ways that are a little different.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_basic_snapshotting">Basic Snapshotting</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For the basic workflow of staging content and committing it to your history, there are only a few basic commands.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_add">git add</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git add</code> command adds content from the working directory into the staging area (or &#8220;index&#8221;) for the next commit.
When the <code>git commit</code> command is run, by default it only looks at this staging area, so <code>git add</code> is used to craft what exactly you would like your next commit snapshot to look like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command is an incredibly important command in Git and is mentioned or used dozens of times in this book.
We&#8217;ll quickly cover some of the unique uses that can be found.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We first introduce and explain <code>git add</code> in detail in <a href="#_tracking_files">Tracking New Files</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We mention how to use it to resolve merge conflicts in <a href="#_basic_merge_conflicts">Basic Merge Conflicts</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We go over using it to interactively stage only specific parts of a modified file in <a href="#_interactive_staging">Interactive Staging</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we emulate it at a low level in <a href="#_tree_objects">Tree Objects</a>, so you can get an idea of what it&#8217;s doing behind the scenes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_status">git status</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git status</code> command will show you the different states of files in your working directory and staging area.
Which files are modified and unstaged and which are staged but not yet committed.
In its normal form, it also will show you some basic hints on how to move files between these stages.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We first cover <code>status</code> in <a href="#_checking_status">Checking the Status of Your Files</a>, both in its basic and simplified forms.
While we use it throughout the book, pretty much everything you can do with the <code>git status</code> command is covered there.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_diff">git diff</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git diff</code> command is used when you want to see differences between any two trees.
This could be the difference between your working environment and your staging area (<code>git diff</code> by itself), between your staging area and your last commit (<code>git diff --staged</code>), or between two commits (<code>git diff master branchB</code>).</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We first look at the basic uses of <code>git diff</code> in <a href="#_git_diff_staged">Viewing Your Staged and Unstaged Changes</a>, where we show how to see what changes are staged and which are not yet staged.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use it to look for possible whitespace issues before committing with the <code>--check</code> option in <a href="#_commit_guidelines">Commit Guidelines</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We see how to check the differences between branches more effectively with the <code>git diff A...B</code> syntax in <a href="#_what_is_introduced">Determining What Is Introduced</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use it to filter out whitespace differences with <code>-b</code> and how to compare different stages of conflicted files with <code>--theirs</code>, <code>--ours</code> and <code>--base</code> in <a href="#_advanced_merging">Advanced Merging</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we use it to effectively compare submodule changes with <code>--submodule</code> in <a href="#_starting_submodules">Starting with Submodules</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_difftool">git difftool</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git difftool</code> command simply launches an external tool to show you the difference between two trees in case you want to use something other than the built in <code>git diff</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We only briefly mention this in <a href="#_git_diff_staged">Viewing Your Staged and Unstaged Changes</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_commit">git commit</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git commit</code> command takes all the file contents that have been staged with <code>git add</code> and records a new permanent snapshot in the database and then moves the branch pointer on the current branch up to it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We first cover the basics of committing in <a href="#_committing_changes">Committing Your Changes</a>.
There we also demonstrate how to use the <code>-a</code> flag to skip the <code>git add</code> step in daily workflows and how to use the <code>-m</code> flag to pass a commit message in on the command line instead of firing up an editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_undoing">Undoing Things</a> we cover using the <code>--amend</code> option to redo the most recent commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_git_branches_overview">Branches in a Nutshell</a>, we go into much more detail about what <code>git commit</code> does and why it does it like that.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We looked at how to sign commits cryptographically with the <code>-S</code> flag in <a href="#_signing_commits">Signing Commits</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we take a look at what the <code>git commit</code> command does in the background and how it&#8217;s actually implemented in <a href="#_git_commit_objects">Commit Objects</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_reset_2">git reset</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git reset</code> command is primarily used to undo things, as you can possibly tell by the verb.
It moves around the <code>HEAD</code> pointer and optionally changes the <code>index</code> or staging area and can also optionally change the working directory if you use <code>--hard</code>.
This final option makes it possible for this command to lose your work if used incorrectly, so make sure you understand it before using it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We first effectively cover the simplest use of <code>git reset</code> in <a href="#_unstaging">Unstaging a Staged File</a>, where we use it to unstage a file we had run <code>git add</code> on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We then cover it in quite some detail in <a href="#_git_reset">Reset Demystified</a>, which is entirely devoted to explaining this command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use <code>git reset --hard</code> to abort a merge in <a href="#_abort_merge">Aborting a Merge</a>, where we also use <code>git merge --abort</code>, which is a bit of a wrapper for the <code>git reset</code> command.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_rm">git rm</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git rm</code> command is used to remove files from the staging area and working directory for Git.
It is similar to <code>git add</code> in that it stages a removal of a file for the next commit.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We cover the <code>git rm</code> command in some detail in <a href="#_removing_files">Removing Files</a>, including recursively removing files and only removing files from the staging area but leaving them in the working directory with <code>--cached</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The only other differing use of <code>git rm</code> in the book is in <a href="#_removing_objects">Removing Objects</a> where we briefly use and explain the <code>--ignore-unmatch</code> when running <code>git filter-branch</code>, which simply makes it not error out when the file we are trying to remove doesn&#8217;t exist.
This can be useful for scripting purposes.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_mv_2">git mv</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git mv</code> command is a thin convenience command to move a file and then run <code>git add</code> on the new file and <code>git rm</code> on the old file.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We only briefly mention this command in <a href="#_git_mv">Moving Files</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_clean_2">git clean</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git clean</code> command is used to remove unwanted files from your working directory.
This could include removing temporary build artifacts or merge conflict files.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We cover many of the options and scenarios in which you might used the clean command in <a href="#_git_clean">Cleaning your Working Directory</a>.</p>
</div>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_branching_and_merging">Branching and Merging</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are just a handful of commands that implement most of the branching and merging functionality in Git.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_branch">git branch</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git branch</code> command is actually something of a branch management tool.
It can list the branches you have, create a new branch, delete branches and rename branches.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Most of <a href="#_git_branching">Git Branching</a> is dedicated to the <code>branch</code> command and it&#8217;s used throughout the entire chapter.
We first introduce it in <a href="#_create_new_branch">Creating a New Branch</a> and we go through most of its other features (listing and deleting) in <a href="#_branch_management">Branch Management</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_tracking_branches">Tracking Branches</a> we use the <code>git branch -u</code> option to set up a tracking branch.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we go through some of what it does in the background in <a href="#_git_refs">Git References</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_checkout">git checkout</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git checkout</code> command is used to switch branches and check content out into your working directory.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We first encounter the command in <a href="#_switching_branches">Switching Branches</a> along with the <code>git branch</code> command.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We see how to use it to start tracking branches with the <code>--track</code> flag in <a href="#_tracking_branches">Tracking Branches</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use it to reintroduce file conflicts with <code>--conflict=diff3</code> in <a href="#_checking_out_conflicts">Checking Out Conflicts</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We go into closer detail on its relationship with <code>git reset</code> in <a href="#_git_reset">Reset Demystified</a>.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we go into some implementation detail in <a href="#_the_head">The HEAD</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_merge">git merge</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git merge</code> tool is used to merge one or more branches into the branch you have checked out.
It will then advance the current branch to the result of the merge.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git merge</code> command was first introduced in <a href="#_basic_branching">Basic Branching</a>.
Though it is used in various places in the book, there are very few variations of the <code>merge</code> command&#8201;&#8212;&#8201;generally just <code>git merge &lt;branch&gt;</code> with the name of the single branch you want to merge in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We covered how to do a squashed merge (where Git merges the work but pretends like it&#8217;s just a new commit without recording the history of the branch you&#8217;re merging in) at the very end of <a href="#_public_project">Forked Public Project</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We went over a lot about the merge process and command, including the <code>-Xignore-space-change</code> command and the <code>--abort</code> flag to abort a problem merge in <a href="#_advanced_merging">Advanced Merging</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We learned how to verify signatures before merging if your project is using GPG signing in <a href="#_signing_commits">Signing Commits</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we learned about Subtree merging in <a href="#_subtree_merge">Subtree Merging</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_mergetool">git mergetool</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git mergetool</code> command simply launches an external merge helper in case you have issues with a merge in Git.</p>

<div class="paragraph">
<p>We mention it quickly in <a href="#_basic_merge_conflicts">Basic Merge Conflicts</a> and go into detail on how to implement your own external merge tool in <a href="#_external_merge_tools">External Merge and Diff Tools</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_log">git log</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git log</code> command is used to show the reachable recorded history of a project from the most recent commit snapshot backwards.
By default it will only show the history of the branch you&#8217;re currently on, but can be given different or even multiple heads or branches from which to traverse.
It is also often used to show differences between two or more branches at the commit level.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command is used in nearly every chapter of the book to demonstrate the history of a project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We introduce the command and cover it in some depth in <a href="#_viewing_history">Viewing the Commit History</a>.
There we look at the <code>-p</code> and <code>--stat</code> option to get an idea of what was introduced in each commit and the <code>--pretty</code> and <code>--oneline</code> options to view the history more concisely, along with some simple date and author filtering options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_create_new_branch">Creating a New Branch</a> we use it with the <code>--decorate</code> option to easily visualize where our branch pointers are located and we also use the <code>--graph</code> option to see what divergent histories look like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_private_team">Private Small Team</a> and <a href="#_commit_ranges">Commit Ranges</a> we cover the <code>branchA..branchB</code> syntax to use the <code>git log</code> command to see what commits are unique to a branch relative to another branch.
In <a href="#_commit_ranges">Commit Ranges</a> we go through this fairly extensively.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_merge_log">Merge Log</a> and <a href="#_triple_dot">Triple Dot</a> we cover using the <code>branchA...branchB</code> format and the <code>--left-right</code> syntax to see what is in one branch or the other but not in both.
In <a href="#_merge_log">Merge Log</a> we also look at how to use the <code>--merge</code> option to help with merge conflict debugging as well as using the <code>--cc</code> option to look at merge commit conflicts in your history.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_git_reflog">RefLog Shortnames</a> we use the <code>-g</code> option to view the Git reflog through this tool instead of doing branch traversal.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_searching">Searching</a> we look at using the <code>-S</code> and <code>-L</code> options to do fairly sophisticated searches for something that happened historically in the code such as seeing the history of a function.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_signing_commits">Signing Commits</a> we see how to use <code>--show-signature</code> to add a validation string to each commit in the <code>git log</code> output based on if it was validly signed or not.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_stash">git stash</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git stash</code> command is used to temporarily store uncommitted work in order to clean out your working directory without having to commit unfinished work on a branch.</p>

<p>The <code>git tag</code> command is used to give a permanent bookmark to a specific point in the code history.
Generally this is used for things like releases.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command is introduced and covered in detail in <a href="#_git_tagging">Tagging</a> and we use it in practice in <a href="#_tagging_releases">Tagging Your Releases</a>.</p>

<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_sharing_and_updating_projects">Sharing and Updating Projects</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are not very many commands in Git that access the network, nearly all of the commands operate on the local database.
When you are ready to share your work or pull changes from elsewhere, there are a handful of commands that deal with remote repositories.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_fetch">git fetch</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git fetch</code> command communicates with a remote repository and fetches down all the information that is in that repository that is not in your current one and stores it in your local database.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We first look at this command in <a href="#_fetching_and_pulling">Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes</a> and we continue to see examples of it use in <a href="#_remote_branches">Remote Branches</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also use it in several of the examples in <a href="#_contributing_project">Contributing to a Project</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use it to fetch a single specific reference that is outside of the default space in <a href="#_pr_refs">Pull Request Refs</a> and we see how to fetch from a bundle in <a href="#_bundling">Bundling</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We set up highly custom refspecs in order to make <code>git fetch</code> do something a little different than the default in <a href="#_refspec">The Refspec</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_pull">git pull</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git pull</code> command is basically a combination of the <code>git fetch</code> and <code>git merge</code> commands, where Git will fetch from the remote you specify and then immediately try to merge it into the branch you&#8217;re on.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We introduce it quickly in <a href="#_fetching_and_pulling">Fetching and Pulling from Your Remotes</a> and show how to see what it will merge if you run it in <a href="#_inspecting_remote">Inspecting a Remote</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also see how to use it to help with rebasing difficulties in <a href="#_rebase_rebase">Rebase When You Rebase</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We show how to use it with a URL to pull in changes in a one-off fashion in <a href="#_checking_out_remotes">Checking Out Remote Branches</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, we very quickly mention that you can use the <code>--verify-signatures</code> option to it in order to verify that commits you are pulling have been GPG signed in <a href="#_signing_commits">Signing Commits</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_push">git push</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git push</code> command is used to communicate with another repository, calculate what your local database has that the remote one does not, and then pushes the difference into the other repository.
It requires write access to the other repository and so normally is authenticated somehow.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We first look at the <code>git push</code> command in <a href="#_pushing_remotes">Pushing to Your Remotes</a>.
Here we cover the basics of pushing a branch to a remote repository.
In <a href="#_pushing_branches">Pushing</a> we go a little deeper into pushing specific branches and in <a href="#_tracking_branches">Tracking Branches</a> we see how to set up tracking branches to automatically push to.
In <a href="#_delete_branches">Deleting Remote Branches</a> we use the <code>--delete</code> flag to delete a branch on the server with <code>git push</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Throughout <a href="#_contributing_project">Contributing to a Project</a> we see several examples of using <code>git push</code> to share work on branches through multiple remotes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We see how to use it to share tags that you have made with the <code>--tags</code> option in <a href="#_sharing_tags">Sharing Tags</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_publishing_submodules">Publishing Submodule Changes</a> we use the <code>--recurse-submodules</code> option to check that all of our submodules work has been published before pushing the superproject, which can be really helpful when using submodules.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_other_client_hooks">Other Client Hooks</a> we talk briefly about the <code>pre-push</code> hook, which is a script we can setup to run before a push completes to verify that it should be allowed to push.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Finally, in <a href="#_pushing_refspecs">Pushing Refspecs</a> we look at pushing with a full refspec instead of the general shortcuts that are normally used.
This can help you be very specific about what work you wish to share.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_remote">git remote</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git remote</code> command is a management tool for your record of remote repositories.
It allows you to save long URLs as short handles, such as &#8220;origin&#8221; so you don&#8217;t have to type them out all the time.
You can have several of these and the <code>git remote</code> command is used to add, change and delete them.</p>

<h4 id="_git_describe">git describe</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git describe</code> command is used to take anything that resolves to a commit and produces a string that is somewhat human-readable and will not change.
It&#8217;s a way to get a description of a commit that is as unambiguous as a commit SHA-1 but more understandable.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use <code>git describe</code> in <a href="#_build_number">Generating a Build Number</a> and <a href="#_preparing_release">Preparing a Release</a> to get a string to name our release file after.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_debugging_2">Debugging</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git has a couple of commands that are used to help debug an issue in your code.
This ranges from figuring out where something was introduced to figuring out who introduced it.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_bisect">git bisect</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git bisect</code> tool is an incredibly helpful debugging tool used to find which specific commit was the first one to introduce a bug or problem by doing an automatic binary search.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is fully covered in <a href="#_binary_search">Binary Search</a> and is only mentioned in that section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_blame">git blame</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git blame</code> command annotates the lines of any file with which commit was the last one to introduce a change to each line of the file and what person authored that commit.
This is helpful in order to find the person to ask for more information about a specific section of your code.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is covered in <a href="#_file_annotation">File Annotation</a> and is only mentioned in that section.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_grep_2">git grep</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git grep</code> command can help you find any string or regular expression in any of the files in your source code, even older versions of your project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>It is covered in <a href="#_git_grep">Git Grep</a> and is only mentioned in that section.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_patching">Patching</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>A few commands in Git are centered around the concept of thinking of commits in terms of the changes they introduce, as though the commit series is a series of patches.
These commands help you manage your branches in this manner.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_cherry_pick">git cherry-pick</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git cherry-pick</code> command is used to take the change introduced in a single Git commit and try to re-introduce it as a new commit on the branch you&#8217;re currently on.
This can be useful to only take one or two commits from a branch individually rather than merging in the branch which takes all the changes.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Cherry picking is described and demonstrated in <a href="#_rebase_cherry_pick">Rebasing and Cherry-Picking Workflows</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_rebase">git rebase</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git rebase</code> command is basically an automated <code>cherry-pick</code>.
It determines a series of commits and then cherry-picks them one by one in the same order somewhere else.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Rebasing is covered in detail in <a href="#_rebasing">Rebasing</a>, including covering the collaborative issues involved with rebasing branches that are already public.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use it in practice during an example of splitting your history into two separate repositories in <a href="#_replace">Replace</a>, using the <code>--onto</code> flag as well.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We go through running into a merge conflict during rebasing in <a href="#_rerere">Rerere</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also use it in an interactive scripting mode with the <code>-i</code> option in <a href="#_changing_multiple">Changing Multiple Commit Messages</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_revert">git revert</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git revert</code> command is essentially a reverse <code>git cherry-pick</code>.
It creates a new commit that applies the exact opposite of the change introduced in the commit you&#8217;re targeting, essentially undoing or reverting it.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use this in <a href="#_reverse_commit">Reverse the commit</a> to undo a merge commit.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_email">Email</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Many Git projects, including Git itself, are entirely maintained over mailing lists.
Git has a number of tools built into it that help make this process easier, from generating patches you can easily email to applying those patches from an email box.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_apply">git apply</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git apply</code> command applies a patch created with the <code>git diff</code> or even GNU diff command.
It is similar to what the <code>patch</code> command might do with a few small differences.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We demonstrate using it and the circumstances in which you might do so in <a href="#_patches_from_email">Applying Patches from Email</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_am_2">git am</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git am</code> command is used to apply patches from an email inbox, specifically one that is mbox formatted.
This is useful for receiving patches over email and applying them to your project easily.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We covered usage and workflow around <code>git am</code> in <a href="#_git_am">Applying a Patch with <code>am</code></a> including using the <code>--resolved</code>, <code>-i</code> and <code>-3</code> options.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There are also a number of hooks you can use to help with the workflow around <code>git am</code> and they are all covered in <a href="#_email_hooks">Email Workflow Hooks</a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also use it to apply patch formatted GitHub Pull Request changes in <a href="#_email_notifications">Email Notifications</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_format_patch">git format-patch</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git format-patch</code> command is used to generate a series of patches in mbox format that you can use to send to a mailing list properly formatted.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We go through an example of contributing to a project using the <code>git format-patch</code> tool in <a href="#_project_over_email">Public Project over Email</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_imap_send">git imap-send</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git imap-send</code> command uploads a mailbox generated with <code>git format-patch</code> into an IMAP drafts folder.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We go through an example of contributing to a project by sending patches with the <code>git imap-send</code> tool in <a href="#_project_over_email">Public Project over Email</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_send_email">git send-email</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git send-email</code> command is used to send patches that are generated with <code>git format-patch</code> over email.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We go through an example of contributing to a project by sending patches with the <code>git send-email</code> tool in <a href="#_project_over_email">Public Project over Email</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_request_pull">git request-pull</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git request-pull</code> command is simply used to generate an example message body to email to someone.
If you have a branch on a public server and want to let someone know how to integrate those changes without sending the patches over email, you can run this command and send the output to the person you want to pull the changes in.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We demonstrate how to use <code>git request-pull</code> to generate a pull message in <a href="#_public_project">Forked Public Project</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_external_systems">External Systems</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>Git comes with a few commands to integrate with other version control systems.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_svn_2">git svn</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git svn</code> command is used to communicate with the Subversion version control system as a client.
This means you can use Git to checkout from and commit to a Subversion server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command is covered in depth in <a href="#_git_svn">Git and Subversion</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_fast_import">git fast-import</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>For other version control systems or importing from nearly any format, you can use <code>git fast-import</code> to quickly map the other format to something Git can easily record.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command is covered in depth in <a href="#_custom_importer">A Custom Importer</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_administration_2">Administration</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>If you&#8217;re administering a Git repository or need to fix something in a big way, Git provides a number of administrative commands to help you out.</p>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_gc_2">git gc</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git gc</code> command runs &#8220;garbage collection&#8221; on your repository, removing unnecessary files in your database and packing up the remaining files into a more efficient format.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>This command normally runs in the background for you, though you can manually run it if you wish.
We go over some examples of this in <a href="#_git_gc">Maintenance</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_fsck">git fsck</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git fsck</code> command is used to check the internal database for problems or inconsistencies.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We only quickly use this once in <a href="#_data_recovery">Data Recovery</a> to search for dangling objects.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_reflog_2">git reflog</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git reflog</code> command goes through a log of where all the heads of your branches have been as you work to find commits you may have lost through rewriting histories.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We cover this command mainly in <a href="#_git_reflog">RefLog Shortnames</a>, where we show normal usage to and how to use <code>git log -g</code> to view the same information with <code>git log</code> output.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also go through a practical example of recovering such a lost branch in <a href="#_data_recovery">Data Recovery</a>.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect3">
<h4 id="_git_filter_branch">git filter-branch</h4>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The <code>git filter-branch</code> command is used to rewrite loads of commits according to certain patterns, like removing a file everywhere or filtering the entire repository down to a single subdirectory for extracting a project.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_removing_file_every_commit">Removing a File from Every Commit</a> we explain the command and explore several different options such as <code>--commit-filter</code>, <code>--subdirectory-filter</code> and <code>--tree-filter</code>.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>In <a href="#_git_p4">Git-p4</a> and <a href="#_git_tfs">TFS</a> we use it to fix up imported external repositories.</p>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect2">
<h3 id="_plumbing_commands">Plumbing Commands</h3>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>There were also quite a number of lower level plumbing commands that we encountered in the book.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The first one we encounter is <code>ls-remote</code> in <a href="#_pr_refs">Pull Request Refs</a> which we use to look at the raw references on the server.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We use <code>ls-files</code> in <a href="#_manual_remerge">Manual File Re-merging</a>, <a href="#_rerere">Rerere</a> and <a href="#_the_index">The Index</a> to take a more raw look at what your staging area looks like.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>We also mention <code>rev-parse</code> in <a href="#_branch_references">Branch References</a> to take just about any string and turn it into an object SHA-1.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>However, most of the low level plumbing commands we cover are in <a href="#_git_internals">Git Internals</a>, which is more or less what the chapter is focused on.
We tried to avoid use of them throughout most of the rest of the book.</p>
